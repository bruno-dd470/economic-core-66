  We propose a geometric and algebraic unification of particle physics and cosmology by replacing the paradigm of quantum fields on a fixed spacetime background with a relational pre‑geometric substrate based on the Clifford algebra $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ [@Clifford1878; @Hestenes1984]. Integrating P. Rowlands' nilpotent formalism (emergent spin, active vacuum, native Pauli exclusion) [@Rowlands2007] and J.-P. Petit's Janus bimetric model (negative masses, self-generated expansion, Dipole Repeller) [@Petit2024], we demonstrate that both frameworks are orthogonal projections of a single dual invariant. The Dirac equation is derived directly from the algebraic closure, and a unified variational principle on a 72‑dimensional manifold is introduced, from which all equations of motion follow.

  Elementary particles are defined as stable configurations of relational angles, encoded by 144 nilpotent pentads arising from a spectral partition of $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ into 12 regulatory leaves. Fundamental interactions are reformulated as geometric rearrangements driven by a transition operator $T$, eliminating virtual gauge bosons and naturally regularizing UV/IR divergences.

  Using Gabriele Nebe's extremal unimodular lattice $\Lambda_{72}$, we diagonalise its Gram matrix $G_{72}$ to obtain 72 eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ that serve as spectral frequencies for the pentad network. The fundamental scale $\Lambda_{\text{fund}} = \sqrt{\lambda_1 / \lambda_2} \cdot \Delta_0 = 7.726$ MeV emerges from the spectral geometry of $\Lambda_{72}$, where $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are the two smallest eigenvalues of $G_{72}$ and $\Delta_0$ is the spectral gap of the discrete Dirac operator. The electron mass is derived from a superposition of four cyclic orbits in the lattice, yielding $m_e = 0.51100$ MeV (deviation $0.0007\%$). Particles are represented by activation vectors $v \in \mathbb{R}^{144}$ built from selected eigenvalues, octave factors $4^{n}$, and signs. Their masses are computed as $m = \Lambda_{\text{fund}} \cdot \|\mathbf{W}^T v\|_2$, where $\mathbf{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{144\times 10}$ is a projection matrix constructed from the eigenvectors of $G_{72}$. Applying this geometric mass formula with optimised indices and relative octaves, we reproduce the masses of ten fundamental particles with remarkable accuracy:

  - Light hadrons ($\pi$, $K$, $p$): deviations $<0.3\%$ (best: $0.01\%$ for $K$ and $p$).
  - Muon ($\mu$): deviation $0.11\%$.
  - Heavy quarkonia ($J/\psi$, $\Upsilon$): deviations $<0.15\%$ (best: $0.02\%$ for $J/\psi$).
  - Electroweak bosons ($W$, $Z$): deviations $<0.2\%$ ($Z$: $0.01\%$, $W$: $0.20\%$).
  - Higgs boson ($H$): deviation $0.06\%$.
  - Magnetar resonance (200 MeV): deviation $0.15\%$.

  Beyond particle physics, the model also matches astrophysical observations: a systematic search for pentad pair configurations yielding $E_{\text{em}} / E_{\text{obs}} = 3$ (i.e. $\lambda_{\text{obs}} / \lambda_{\text{em}} = 3$, redshift $z = 2$) gives an exact numerical match, reproducing the factor reported by Petit and D'Agostini [@Petit_DAgostini_2025] for the hypermassive objects M87* and SgrA*. This provides an independent observational confirmation of the pentadic geometry at the galactic scale.

  At the cosmological scale, the cosmological constant, dark matter, and dark energy emerge as macroscopic projections of the local coupling density between cosmic and anti‑cosmic sectors. The architecture is organised across scales via Bott periodicity, with the 200 MeV resonance in magnetars identified as an inter‑octave transition. This self‑regulating relational framework yields testable signatures — including a predicted low‑energy deviation in $e^+e^-\to\gamma\gamma$ cross‑sections, annular negative lensing around cosmic voids, and a strict $E_{\text{res}}\propto B^2$ scaling in magnetars — and paves the way for a unified physics where micro and macro scales, as well as algebra and geometry, are two facets of the same relational invariant. doi: doi: [10.5281/zenodo.19947629](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19947629)

# 0. From West to East

## Introduction: A Shift in Perspective – From Substance to Relation

For over two millennia, Western thought, heir to Aristotle, has been built around a central question: **what is a thing "in itself"?** Whether through substance, essence, the atom, or the elementary particle, Western physics and metaphysics have sought to isolate fundamental entities endowed with intrinsic properties, existing by themselves, independently of their environment or relations.

In contrast, the philosophies of East Asia – Taoism, Confucianism, Buddhism – have often privileged another intuition: **nothing exists by itself**; every "thing" is merely a temporary knot in a fabric of relations. Reality there is not a collection of objects, but a network of processes, interdependencies, and transformations. The *Dao* is not a thing, but the way in which things hold together.

The present article, although written in the formal language of contemporary physics – Clifford algebras, gauge theories, bimetric cosmology – belongs to this second tradition. It does not start from the question: "What is the ultimate particle?", but from: **"What stable relations can emerge from a pre-geometric network?"**

### From the Point to the Network: A Relational Refoundation of Physics

The central hypothesis of this work is that spacetime, mass, charge, spin, and even cosmic expansion are not primitive properties, but **emergent properties of stable angular configurations** within a relational algebraic structure: the Clifford algebra $\mathrm{Cl}(6,6)$.

Far from the standard model where quantum fields oscillate on a fixed spacetime stage, we propose here a **relational substrate** where:

- elementary objects (particles) are **pentads** – sets of five algebraic orientations,
- interactions are not exchanges of virtual bosons but **angular rearrangements** governed by a transition operator $T$,
- the vacuum is not a neutral state but an **active partner** (a negative-mass sector) coupling each particle to its virtual image,
- three-dimensional space emerges **statistically** from the impossibility for two pentads to share the same orientation (native exclusion principle).

### An Unprecedented Synthesis: Rowlands, Petit, Nebe

This relational physics concretizes a triple encounter, previously considered heterodox:

- **Peter Rowlands** (nilpotent algebra) shows that the Dirac equation, spin 1/2, and renormalization follow from a single condition: $(g\cdot x)^2 = 0$.
- **Jean-Pierre Petit** (Janus cosmology) describes a universe with two sectors – positive and negative masses – producing accelerated expansion and dark matter without ad hoc constants.
- **Gabriele Nebe** (lattice $\Lambda_{72}$) provides a discrete 72-dimensional space whose eigenvalues numerically encode particle masses.

In our approach, these three frameworks are not competing theories, but **the three orthogonal projections of a single relational invariant**: that of the 144 nilpotent pentads of $\mathrm{Cl}(6,6)$.

### A Physics without "Thing in Itself", Testable

This ontological reversal is not a mere philosophical statement. It yields **quantitative predictions**:

- the masses of the pion, kaon, proton, muon, $W, Z, H$ bosons, and the 200 MeV magnetar resonance are reproduced with deviations often below 0.2%,
- a redshift $z = 2$ is predicted for hypermassive objects like $M87^*$ and Sgr A*,
- annular dimming of light around large cosmic voids (negative gravitational lensing) is expected,
- a quadratic dependence $E_{\text{res}} \propto B^2$ for magnetars is predicted, testable immediately with Fermi-LAT data.

### An Epistemology of Connection

Finally, this article embraces an epistemological dimension rare in contemporary physics: it acknowledges that the **relational invariants** it formalizes today were glimpsed, by other means, in ancient traditions – the Yi Jing, the Wu Xing, the Sefer Yetzirah. Not because those traditions "contained" modern physics, but because any form of thought constrained by the need to reduce combinatorial complexity to stable functional classes encounters analogous structures.

This is not a return to the past. It is an expansion of our conception of rationality: **physics is not condemned to the atom or the particle; it can choose relation as a primitive.**

Thus, the reader will find in the following pages not yet another theory wedded to the Western paradigm of the "thing in itself", but **an attempt to refound physics on a relational philosophy** – closer to Buddhist *pratītyasamutpāda* or Taoist *Dao* than to Aristotelian *ousia*. The mathematical tools (Clifford algebras, lattices, nilpotence) are Western; the spirit of the approach – seeing the world as a fabric of angles, cycles, and relations – is universal, but finds its deepest roots in the East.

Welcome to a physics where **we no longer say what a thing is, but how it connects.**

# 1. Introduction & Unified Pre-Geometric Framework

## 1.1 Beyond fields and fixed spacetime background

Contemporary physics rests on a dual paradigm: on one side, quantum field theory describes particles as excitations of fields defined on a fixed spacetime background; on the other, general relativity makes this background a dynamic geometry curved by matter. This dichotomy generates persistent structural tensions: divergences requiring ad hoc renormalization, introduction of cosmological constants or virtual bosons to bridge observational gaps, and conceptual difficulties in unifying micro and macro scales. We propose here a paradigm shift: abandoning the idea of a passive background in favor of a relational pre-geometric substrate, where spacetime, mass, charge, and spin are not primitives, but emergent properties of stable algebraic configurations [@Clifford1878; @Hestenes1984]. This substrate is structured by three complementary pillars:

- The Clifford algebra $\text{Cl}(6,6)$, which encodes the relational network of 12 generators [@Clifford1878; @Hestenes1984].
- Rowlands' nilpotent formalism, which gives emergent spin, active vacuum, and native Pauli exclusion [@Rowlands2007].
- Petit's Janus bimetric cosmology, which describes the interaction of positive and negative mass sectors [@Petit2024].
- Nebe's extremal lattice $\Lambda_{72}$, which provides a discrete configuration space of dimension 72 whose eigenvalues encode the mass scale of hadrons [@Nebe2010].

**Epistemological note on the scope of this work**
The unification proposed here brings together three frameworks, each of which lies outside the mainstream of contemporary physics: Rowlands' nilpotent algebra (little known), Petit's Janus cosmology (controversial in the standard cosmological community), and Nebe's extremal lattice (a purely mathematical construction). The resulting synthesis is therefore fragile: the rejection of any of these pillars would invalidate the whole edifice. Moreover, the connection between the eigenvalues of $\Lambda_{72}$ and particle masses is heuristic; no dynamical mechanism (such as Higgs-like coupling) is provided to derive it from first principles. This work should therefore be regarded as a proof-of-concept, not as a definitive theory.

**Warning on terminology.** The terms WuXing, YiJing, Sefer Yetzirah, Merkabah, and Platonic solids are used here as empirical anticipations – historically grounded insights that grasped, through qualitative reasoning and symbolic codification, structural patterns that can now be expressed in modern mathematics. No claim of literal identity is made; these traditions did not anticipate Clifford algebras or nilpotent operators. Yet, to ignore their structural convergence would be to impoverish the intellectual history of the ideas we now formalize. The mathematical content of this paper stands independently of these references. This is a tribute – not a proof – to those who perceived aspects of the same relational invariants that we are only now learning to write in equations.

## 1.2 The $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ algebraic substrate: a pre-geometric relational network
In this framework, the fundamental degrees of freedom are not propagating fields, but angular relations between the twelve generators of a Clifford algebra of signature $(6,6)$, denoted $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ [@Rowlands2007]. Six generators $\{e_1,\dots,e_6\}$ structure the observable cosmic sector, while six others $\{f_1,\dots,f_6\}$ constitute its anti-cosmic conjugate. An isolated generator has no direct physical meaning; only the relational structure—mutual angles, Clifford products, and nilpotent closure conditions—encodes physical information. This substrate is not a "space" in the usual sense, but a closed combinatorial network whose geometry emerges statistically from the orientation of spin axes. As established by Peter Rowlands, three-dimensional Euclidean space is the macroscopic manifestation of the distribution of possible spin orientations in the algebraic vacuum: each fermion is intrinsically one-dimensional (a single spin axis at any given instant), but the superposition of all possible axes reconstructs the observed three-dimensionality [@Rowlands2007].

## 1.3 Central hypothesis: particles, vacuum, and transitions as angular rearrangements
We postulate that an elementary particle is not a point object evolving on a background, but a stable configuration of angular relations within the $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ network, encoded by a pentad $P = \{B_1, B_2, B_3, F, S\}$:

- **Structure** $\{B_1, B_2, B_3\}$: three bivectors fixing identity, flavor, and internal symmetry.
- **Fire** $F = i'v$: axial element carrying chirality and weak coupling.
- **Water** $S = 1v$: polar element carrying mass/substance and charge orientation.

Each pentad is nilpotent by construction, ensuring network stability and absence of divergent feedback loops [@Rowlands2007]. Fundamental interactions ($\beta$ decay, annihilation, fusion, neutrino oscillations, pair production) no longer result from the exchange of virtual gauge bosons, but from geometric rearrangements: the dissolution of an angular configuration and the reformation of new stable pentads, governed by a transition operator $T$ acting on the Hilbert space of the 144 pentads of $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ (see Appendix V). Rowlands' vacuum and Petit's negative cosmos are merely two facets of the same dynamic partner with which each fermion continuously exchanges energy, information, and spin orientation [@Rowlands2007; @Petit2024].

The quintuple structure $\{B_1, B_2, B_3, F, S\}$ of each pentad naturally evokes the WuXing cycle, the five phases or generating agents of classical Chinese thought — Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water — whose cyclic interactions follow two complementary orders: the generation cycle, \textit{sheng}) and the domination cycle \textit{ke}). Likewise, in our formalism, the five components of the pentad are not static entities but relational generators whose angular rearrangements, driven by the operator $T$, produce transitions between particles. The \textit{sheng} and \textit{ke} modes structure respectively the cosmic partitions $e_i$ (expansion, exploration) and anti-cosmic partitions $f_j$ (constraint, regulation).

## 1.4 Objectives and document structure
This work pursues three complementary objectives.

1. **Structural foundations**: formalize the $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ reservoir and demonstrate how postulated spectral partition into 12 regulatory partitions generates exactly 144 nilpotent pentads, all preserving the condition $(g\cdot x)^2=0$.
2. **Integration of spin and active vacuum**: rigorously incorporate Rowlands' nilpotent Dirac formalism (emergent spin, helicity, vacuum as partner, topological Pauli exclusion) [@Rowlands2007] into pentadic encoding, showing that spin $1/2$ and $4\pi$ periodicity are native signatures of the particle/vacuum coupling.
3. **Micro–macro unification**: define the angular transition operator $T$, establish geometric selection rules, link Bott periodicity [@Bott1959] to energy octave jumps (validated by the 200 MeV resonance in magnetars [@FermiLAT]), and show how gravity, cosmic expansion, and large-scale structures emerge as geometric projections of the local pentadic coupling density between sectors $e_i$ and $f_j$.

The document is organized into eleven sections: algebraic foundations (Sec. 2), Janus–Rowlands unification (Sec. 3), spin and dynamic vacuum (Sec. 4), derivation of the Dirac equation (Sec. 5), unified variational principle (Sec. 6), particle encoding (Sec. 7), transition operator and reactions (Sec. 8), cosmological implications (Sec. 9), Bott periodicity and multi-scales (Sec. 10), before concluding on the prospects of a unified relational physics (Sec. 11).

# 2. The $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ Reservoir and the 144 Nilpotent Pentads

## 2.1 Structure of $\text{Cl}(6,6)$: 6 cosmic and 6 anti-cosmic generators
The pre-geometric substrate of our model rests on the Clifford algebra of signature $(6,6)$, denoted $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ [@Hestenes1984]. Unlike $\text{Cl}(6,0)$, which sufficed to encode the static $64 \to 20$ invariant of the genetic code, $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ introduces a structural duality essential for describing particles and their interactions. It possesses 12 fundamental generators:
$$
\{e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\} \quad \text{(cosmic sector, signature $+$)}
$$
$$
\{f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4, f_5, f_6\} \quad \text{(anti-cosmic sector, signature $-$)}
$$
These generators satisfy the usual anticommutation relations:
$$
e_a e_b + e_b e_a = 2\delta_{ab}, \quad f_a f_b + f_b f_a = -2\delta_{ab}, \quad e_a f_b + f_b e_a = 0.
$$
No isolated generator possesses direct physical significance. It is their relational configuration—Clifford products, bivectors, and closure conditions—that encodes observables. This algebraic architecture operationally realizes Petit's Janus duality [@Petit2024]: partitions dominated by $e_i$ correspond to the positive-mass sector, while those dominated by $f_j$ embody the negative-mass sector. The $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ reservoir is thus not a passive space, but a dynamic partner in Rowlands' sense [@Rowlands2007]: each fermion draws its virtual images from it and returns its action/reaction coupling.

## 2.2 The 12 base pentads: $P_1\dots P_6$ (positive) and $N_1\dots N_6$ (negative)
The fundamental algebraic brick is the pentad, an irreducible composite unit arising from the symmetry breaking of $\text{Cl}(6,0)$ [@Rowlands2007]. Each pentad $P$ is an ordered set of five Clifford elements, structured into three physical roles:

- **Structure**: three bivectors $\{B_1, B_2, B_3\}$ fixing identity, flavor, and internal symmetry.
- **Fire**: an axial element $F = i'v$ carrying chirality and weak coupling.
- **Water**: a polar element $S = 1v$ carrying mass/substance and charge orientation.

The 12 base pentads partition into six positive and six negative:
$$
\begin{aligned}
P_1  &= \{iI,\ iJ,\ iK,\ i'k,\ j\}  & N_1  &= \{-iI,\ -iJ,\ -iK,\ -i'k,\ -j\} \\
P_2  &= \{jI,\ jJ,\ jK,\ i'i,\ k\}  & N_2  &= \{-jI,\ -jJ,\ -jK,\ -i'i,\ -k\} \\
P_3  &= \{kI,\ kJ,\ kK,\ i'j,\ i\}  & N_3  &= \{-kI,\ -kJ,\ -kK,\ -i'j,\ -i\} \\
P_4  &= \{i'Ii,\ i'Ij,\ i'K,\ i'K,\ J\}  & N_4  &= \{-i'Ii,\ -i'Ij,\ -i'K,\ -i'K,\ -J\} \\
P_5  &= \{i'Ji,\ i'Jj,\ i'Jk,\ i'I,\ K\}  & N_5  &= \{-i'Ji,\ -i'Jj,\ -i'Jk,\ -i'I,\ -K\} \\
P_6  &= \{i'Ki,\ i'Kj,\ i'Kk,\ i'J,\ I\}  & N_6  &= \{-i'Ki,\ -i'Kj,\ -i'Kk,\ -i'J,\ -I\}
\end{aligned}
$$
Geometrically, each pentad corresponds to one of the 12 pentagonal faces of the dual dodecahedron of the Merkabah. The polarity signature of an attractor (triplet of pentads) determines its admissible degree of redundancy, while the intrinsic nilpotence of each element guarantees network stability without introducing external parameters [@Rowlands2007].

## 2.3 Postulated spectral decomposition into 12 partitions

The complete space of $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ contains $2^{12}=4096$ elements, but physical dynamics do not unfold uniformly within it. We postulate a decomposition into 12 \emph{spectral partitions}, each isomorphic to the dual graph $\Gamma$ but weighted by a dominant generator. This decomposition is not derived from first principles; it is a working hypothesis of the model.

- 6 cosmic partitions $\mathcal{F}_{e_i}$ ($i=1\dots6$): dominated by $e_i$, carry a global orientation $\eta>0$ (\textit{sheng} mode, exploration/generation). They correspond to Janus' observable sector [@Petit2024].
- 6 anti-cosmic partitions $\mathcal{F}_{f_j}$ ($j=1\dots6$): dominated by $f_j$, carry $\eta<0$ (\textit{ke} mode, constraint/regulation). They correspond to the negative-mass sector.

Each leaf $\mathcal{F}_{g}$ ($g \in \{e_1,\dots,e_6,f_1,\dots,f_6\}$) contains the 12 base pentads, modulated by the dominant generator. A generic pentad is thus written:
$$P_k^{(g)} = g \cdot P_k^{\text{base}} = \{g \cdot x \mid x \in P_k^{\text{base}}\}, \quad g \in \{e_i, f_j\}$$
where $P_k^{\text{base}}$ is the base pentad (defined in §2.2) and $\cdot$ denotes the Clifford product.

**Unified notation**:

- $P_k^{(e_i)}$: base pentad $k$ projected onto the cosmic leaf $e_i$ ($\eta>0$, sector $+$)
- $N_k^{(f_j)}$: base pentad $k$ projected onto the anti-cosmic leaf $f_j$ ($\eta<0$, sector $-$)
By construction, $N_k^{(f_j)} = -P_k^{(f_j)}$, where the minus sign is the global inversion of the pentad (phase duality). The set of 144 pentads is thus written:
$$\mathcal{P} = \left\{ P_k^{(g)} \;\middle|\; k=1..12,\; g \in \{e_1,\dots,e_6,f_1,\dots,f_6\} \right\}, \quad |\mathcal{P}| = 12 \times 12 = 144.$$

**Remark:** The 144 nilpotent pentads arise from a spectral partition of $\mathrm{Cl}(6,6)$ into 12 regulatory leaves. 
The decomposition into 12 spectral partitions is postulated as a working hypothesis; a rigorous derivation from the representation theory of $\mathrm{Aut}(\Lambda_{72})$ is left for future work. 

## 2.4 Nilpotence by construction: algebraic proof $(g\cdot x)^2 = 0$ and network stability
The fundamental property inherited from Rowlands' formalism is native nilpotence [@Rowlands2007]. For any element $x$ belonging to a base pentad, we have by construction:
$$
x^2 = 0.
$$
This condition is the algebraic translation of the nilpotent Dirac equation $(\pm ikE \pm i\mathbf{p} + jm)^2 = 0$. It ensures that the fermion and its virtual image in the vacuum form a closed system where self-energy loops cancel exactly (automatic renormalization) [@Rowlands2007].

**Proof of preservation under multiplication by a generator of $\text{Cl}(6,6)$**:
Let $g \in \{e_1\dots e_6, f_1\dots f_6\}$ be any generator, and $x$ an element of a base pentad such that $x^2=0$. Consider the product $y = g \cdot x$. Then:
$$
y^2 = (g x)(g x) = g x g x.
$$
In a Clifford algebra, two distinct generators anticommute: $g x = -x g$ if $g \neq x$ and $\{g,x\}=0$. In this case:
$$
y^2 = g x g x = -g g x x = -g^2 x^2.
$$
Since $x^2 = 0$, we immediately obtain $y^2 = 0$. If $g$ commutes with $x$ (degenerate or scalar case), then $y^2 = g^2 x^2 = 0$ trivially. Thus, nilpotence is strictly preserved for the 144 pentads projected onto the 12 partitions.

**Physical consequences**:

1. **Native Pauli exclusion**: $(g x)^2 = 0$ forbids two pentads from sharing the same instantaneous angular configuration. 3D Euclidean space emerges statistically from the distribution of unique spin axes [@Rowlands2007].
2. **Vacuum/particle coupling stability**: No configuration can self-amplify. The $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ reservoir dissipates instabilities through nilpotent closure, physically realizing Rowlands' algebraic action/reaction principle [@Rowlands2007].
3. **Janus compatibility**: The condition $(g\cdot x)^2=0$ is the microscopic signature of Petit's bimetric conservation $\nabla_\mu(T^{\mu\nu}+\bar{T}^{\mu\nu})=0$ [@Petit2024]. It guarantees that exchanges between sectors $+$ and $-$ generate neither singularities nor ghost energies.

## 2.5 The dual graph $\Gamma$: tropical belts $CP/CN$ and polar thresholds $P_4/N_4$
Regulation dynamics emerge from the dual graph $\Gamma$ constructed from the 12 base pentads. The vertices of $\Gamma$ are the pentads $\{P_1\dots P_6, N_1\dots N_6\}$; an edge connects two pentads if they co-belong to the triplet of the same attractor (sharing a triangular face in the Merkabah).
Topological analysis of $\Gamma$ reveals a remarkable structure:

- **Positive tropical belt $CP$**: disjoint cycle of length 5 $(P_1 \to P_3 \to P_5 \to P_6 \to P_2 \to P_1)$, inducing a complete subgraph $K_5$. It propagates the \textit{sheng} mode (exploration, generation of configurations).
- **Negative tropical belt $CN$**: disjoint cycle $(N_1 \to N_2 \to N_6 \to N_5 \to N_3 \to N_1)$, with two additional internal edges. It propagates the \textit{ke} mode (constraint, regulation, restitution to the vacuum).
- **Polar thresholds $P_4$ and $N_4$**: excluded from cycles, they possess a high degree (8 and 9) and structurally link $CP$ to $CN$. They act as topological hinges: any transition between \textit{sheng} and \textit{ke} regimes, or between cosmic and anti-cosmic sectors, must transit through $P_4$ or $N_4$.

This graphical architecture is not an external projection; it emerges strictly from the combinatorics of the 20 attractor triplets. It defines the space of 320 admissible local regimes and pilots cyclic frustration descent. In the $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ reservoir, the $CP/CN$ belts structure the circulation of pentads across the 12 partitions, while $P_4/N_4$ materialize the bifurcation points where the system endogenously switches between expansion (mode $e_i$) and contraction (mode $f_j$), without external cost functions.

## 2.6 The Merkabah, attractor triplets, and cyclic frustration descent
The concepts of Merkabah, attractor triplets, and cyclic frustration descent are central to the pentadic network dynamics. We introduce them here before their use in subsequent sections.

### 2.6.1. The Merkabah as underlying geometric structure
The Merkabah (literally "chariot" in ancient Hebrew, denoting the divine throne in Jewish mysticism) is used here as a geometric analogy to describe the relational architecture of the $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ network. It is not a mystical reference, but a precise polyhedral structure: a stellated dodecahedron (or compound of two interlaced tetrahedra) whose 12 pentagonal faces correspond to the 12 base pentads.
This structure possesses several remarkable properties:

- **20 triplets of faces**: Each vertex of the Merkabah is formed by the intersection of three pentagonal faces. These 20 triplets are called attractors because they represent stable configurations where three pentads interact.
- **12 pentagonal faces**: Each face corresponds to a base pentad ($P_1$ to $P_6$, $N_1$ to $N_6$).
- **Duality**: The Merkabah is self-dual: its vertices correspond to the faces of the dual polyhedron, reflecting the duality between cosmic ($e_i$) and anti-cosmic ($f_j$) sectors.

### 2.6.2. Attractor triplets: stable three-pentad configurations
An attractor triplet is an ordered set of three pentads $\{X, Y, Z\}$ that meet at a vertex of the Merkabah. Each triplet possesses a polarity signature determined by the number of positive ($P_k$) and negative ($N_k$) pentads it contains:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
Signature & Composition & Example & Role \\
\midrule
3P & Three positive pentads & $\{P_1, P_3, P_5\}$ & Fully cosmic attractor (\textit{sheng} mode) \\
2P+1N & Two positive, one negative & $\{P_2, P_6, N_4\}$ & Mixed attractor (threshold) \\
1P+2N & One positive, two negative & $\{P_4, N_1, N_5\}$ & Mixed attractor (threshold) \\
3N & Three negative pentads & $\{N_2, N_4, N_6\}$ & Fully anti-cosmic attractor (\textit{ke} mode) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Triplets with signature 2P+1N and 1P+2N are particularly important because they correspond to the polar thresholds $P_4$ and $N_4$ introduced in §2.5. They are the only triplets that allow a transition between cosmic and anti-cosmic sectors.

### 2.6.3. Cyclic frustration descent
Frustration is a measure of incompatibility between the angular orientations of pentads within a triplet. When three pentads cannot simultaneously satisfy the nilpotence condition $(g\cdot x)^2=0$, the system is said to be "frustrated". This frustration must be dissipated for the network to return to a stable configuration.
Cyclic frustration descent is the mechanism by which the system evacuates this frustration. This concept, introduced in the present formalism, does not appear in the prior works of Rowlands and Hill [@Rowlands2007] which focus on the static $64 \to 20$ invariant. It is detailed in [@DeDominicis_2026].

**Polarity gradient 3P → 3N**
Frustration descent proceeds via a polarity gradient from triplets 3P (completely cosmic, minimal frustration) to triplets 3N (completely anti-cosmic, maximal frustration), passing through mixed triplets 2P+1N and 1P+2N:
$$
\text{3P} \rightarrow \text{2P+1N} \rightarrow \text{1P+2N} \rightarrow \text{3N}
$$

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
Stage & Signature & Frustration & Dynamic Role \\
\midrule
1 & 3P & Minimal & Ground state, pure \textit{sheng} mode \\
2 & 2P+1N & Low & Entry threshold, transition initiation \\
3 & 1P+2N & High & Exit threshold, evacuation preparation \\
4 & 3N & Maximal & Evacuated state, pure \textit{ke} mode \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

This gradient is not a mandatory linear path, but a topological trend: frustration accumulates in triplets 3N and evacuates through polar thresholds $P_4$ and $N_4$.

**The four stages of descent**

1. **Accumulation**: Frustration increases locally in triplets 3P (e.g., under external perturbation or angular transition).
2. **Propagation**: Frustration propagates along tropical belts $CP$ (\textit{sheng} mode) and $CN$ (\textit{ke} mode), following the 3P → 3N gradient.
3. **Evacuation**: Frustration is evacuated through polar thresholds $P_4$ and $N_4$ (mixed triplets 2P+1N and 1P+2N), which act as topological "valves".
4. **Return to equilibrium**: The system returns to a minimal frustration configuration (triplets 3P) after completing a full cycle on the dual graph $\Gamma$.

Mathematically, frustration descent is described by a relaxation operator $R(t)$ acting on the spectral asymmetry $\eta(t)$:
$$
\frac{d\eta}{dt} = -\frac{1}{\tau_{\text{relax}}} \left( \eta(t) - \eta_{\text{eq}} \right) + \xi(t) - \lambda \cdot \nabla_{\text{polarity}}
$$
where $\tau_{\text{relax}}$ is the characteristic relaxation time, $\xi(t)$ represents fluctuations, and $\nabla_{\text{polarity}}$ is the topological 3P → 3N gradient coupled to the constant $\lambda$.

### 2.6.4. The 320 local regimes: space of admissible configurations
Combinatorial analysis of the Merkabah and dual graph $\Gamma$ reveals an essential structure: 320 admissible local regimes.
These regimes correspond to configurations where frustration is partially relaxed but not fully evacuated. They are obtained by combinatorial exploration:
20 attractor triplets (Merkabah vertices) × 16 internal frustration states (residual angular degrees of freedom) = 320 regimes.
Mathematically, the space of local regimes $\mathcal{R}_{\text{local}}$ is the fibered product:
$$
\mathcal{R}_{\text{local}} = \bigsqcup_{T \in \text{Triplets}} \mathcal{F}_T
$$
where $\mathcal{F}_T$ is the space of frustration states of triplet $T$, of dimension 16.
These 320 regimes play a crucial role in network dynamics:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\small
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{@{}lX@{}}
\toprule
Role & Description \\
\midrule
Transitions & Angular rearrangements ($T_{\text{structure}}$, $T_{\text{fire}}$, etc.) transit the system between regimes. \\
Frustration descent & Frustration descends stepwise: frustrated regime $\to$ partially relaxed regime $\to$ stable attractor. \\
Topological memory & The 320 regimes form an intermediate state space recording transition history. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

The transition map between regimes is governed by the dual graph $\Gamma$: two regimes are connected if their triplets share an edge in $\Gamma$.

### 2.6.5. Link with spectral asymmetry $\eta(t)$
The density of local regimes in a region of space locally determines the spectral asymmetry $\eta(t)$. In particular:

- A high proportion of 2P+1N regimes (polar thresholds) favors $\eta < 0$ (\textit{ke} mode).
- A high proportion of 3P regimes favors $\eta > 0$ (\textit{sheng} mode).
The variable $R_{\text{thr}}(t)$ introduced in §2.5 is precisely the fraction of local regimes located on polar thresholds $P_4$ and $N_4$:
$$
R_{\text{thr}}(t) = \frac{N_{\text{thr}}(t)}{320}
$$
where $N_{\text{thr}}(t)$ is the number of local regimes in threshold configuration at time $t$.

### 2.6.6. Link with the $64 \to 20$ invariant
An important result, from the work of Vanessa Hill in collaboration with Peter Rowlands @Hill_Rowlands_2007, is the combinatorial invariant $64 \to 20$: the 64 possible combinations of pentad triplets reduce, under nilpotent closure, to 20 stable attractors. These 20 attractors correspond exactly to the 20 Merkabah triplets.
This $64 \to 20$ reduction is analogous to the reduction of 64 genetic code codons into 20 amino acids. It illustrates the principle of topological filtration: nilpotence eliminates redundant or unstable configurations, conserving only essential relational structures.
In the $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ framework, this invariant guarantees that, despite the network's combinatorial richness (4096 base elements), only 144 pentads (12 families × 12 partitions) and 20 attractors (stable triplets) are physically relevant.

### 2.6.7. Duality of poles and exclusion of octahedral zones
**The two structural poles**
Although the $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ algebra contains four scalar/pseudo-scalar elements (+1, -1, +i', -i'), the Merkabah geometry retains only two structural poles:

- The scalar pole ($\pm 1$), serving as ontological reference (mass, substance)
- The pseudo-scalar pole ($\pm i'$), encoding phase and time
The $\pm$ signs are not independent poles, but the two algebraic orientations along each of these axes. This binary duality suffices to close the topological network and generate the $3P \rightarrow 3N$ polarity gradient. Counting 4 distinct poles would break the uniform incidence of pentads (5 occurrences per pentad) and make the exact partition into 20 attractors impossible.

**The 8 octahedral zones: why they are excluded**
Polar closure is the topological condition that a stable attractor must be defined by exactly three pentads forming a triplet of fixed signature ($3P$, $2P+1N$, $1P+2N$ or $3N$). The 20 tetrahedral cells of the Merkabah satisfy this condition.
However, the 8 internal octahedral zones (volumetric intersections of the two parent tetrahedra) violate this closure for three reasons:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\small
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{@{}lX@{}}
\toprule
Reason & Explanation \\
\midrule
Excessive incidence & An octahedron involves 4 to 6 pentads simultaneously, preventing reduction to a single triplet. \\
Unresolvable frustration & Octahedral faces are adjacent to tetrahedra of opposite polarities ($3P$ neighbor of $1P+2N$), generating locally undissipable \textit{sheng/ke} phase conflicts. \\
Lack of anchoring & Octahedra contain neither the scalar pole ($+1$) nor the pseudo-scalar pole ($i'$), hence no reference setpoint. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

Consequence: these zones generate intrinsic topological frustration. The formalism naturally excludes them from the $64 \to 20$ filtration process, as they do not satisfy the closure condition required to constitute stable attractors. Their role is not null, but transitional: they materialize the frustration thresholds that the system must bypass to navigate between the 20 stable states.

### 2.6.8. Synthesis: from polyhedron to dynamic network
In summary, the Merkabah provides a base topology (12 faces, 20 vertices) that projects onto the dual graph $\Gamma$ (12 nodes, edges from triplets). Cyclic frustration dynamics is the engine that circulates information between pentads along belts $CP$ and $CN$, while polar thresholds $P_4$ and $N_4$ regulate transitions between \textit{sheng} and \textit{ke} regimes.
This architecture ensures self-regulation without external parameters: frustration accumulates, propagates, evacuates, and the network returns to equilibrium through a purely topological mechanism.

# 3. Rowlands & Petit: Two Faces of the Same Janus Coin

## 3.1 Rowlands' active vacuum vs Petit's negative cosmos: physical identification
Standard physics treats the vacuum as a passive reference state, punctually populated by quantum fluctuations. Peter Rowlands and Jean-Pierre Petit, though operating at radically different scales, share an identical structural postulate: the vacuum is an active dynamic partner, necessary for the very definition of observable matter [@Rowlands2007; @Petit2024].  
In Rowlands' nilpotent approach (Ch. 6) [@Rowlands2007], the vacuum is not an absence, but a structured algebraic reservoir. Every fermion is permanently coupled to its virtual images in the vacuum via quaternionic operators $\{i, j, k\}$. This algebraic action/reaction interaction naturally generates spin $1/2$, CPT symmetry, Pauli exclusion, and intrinsic renormalization through fermion/boson loop cancellation. The vacuum here is a relational grammar: each particle is merely the "kinetic half" of a complete particle/vacuum system [@Rowlands2007].    
In Petit's Janus model [@Petit2024], the "cosmological vacuum" is identified as a negative-mass sector. This sector forms spheroidal conglomerates (anti-H/He) which, through gravitational repulsion with the positive sector, explain the accelerated expansion of the universe without a cosmological constant $\Lambda$, structure large-scale voids (Dipole Repeller) [@Hoffman2017], and impose global zero energy-mass conservation. The vacuum here is a bimetric geometry: $g_{\mu\nu}$ (positive mass) and $\bar{g}_{\mu\nu}$ (negative mass) dynamically coupled [@Petit2024].

**Physical unification**: Rowlands' nilpotent vacuum and Petit's negative cosmos denote the same conjugate entity. Microscopic nilpotence $(g\cdot x)^2=0$ is the algebraic signature of the macroscopic bimetric coupling condition $\nabla_\mu(T^{\mu\nu}+\bar{T}^{\mu\nu})=0$ [@Petit2024]. One describes the relational syntax, the other models the geometric dynamics. They do not oppose each other; they constitute the two orthogonal projections of a fundamental dual invariant.

## 3.2 Algebraic-geometric duality: micro nilpotence ↔ macro bimetricity

The Rowlands nilpotent formalism (microscopic, algebraic) and the Petit Janus model (macroscopic, geometric) are two orthogonal projections of the same Cl(6,6) structure. Their correspondence is established in the following table.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\small
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{@{}lXXX@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Dimension} & \textbf{Rowlands (Micro / Algebra)} & \textbf{Petit (Macro / Geometry)} & \textbf{Cl(6,6) Translation} \\
\midrule
Support & Nilpotent Dirac $(\pm ikE \pm i\mathbf{p} + jm)^2 = 0$ & Bimetric manifold $(M_4, g_{\mu\nu}, \bar{g}_{\mu\nu})$ & Space with 12 generators $\{e_i, f_j\}$ \\
Sector $+$ & Real fermionic state $(E >0, \mathbf{p}, m)$ & Metric $g_{\mu\nu}$, positive masses & partitions dominated by $e_i$ ($\eta >0$, \textit{sheng} mode) \\
Sector $-$ & Active vacuum (virtual images $k,i,j$) & Metric $\bar{g}_{\mu\nu}$, negative masses & partitions dominated by $f_j$ ($\eta <0$, \textit{ke} mode) \\
Coupling & Native nilpotence $(g\cdot x)^2 = 0$ & Interaction tensors $T_{\mu\nu}, \bar{T}_{\mu\nu}$ & 144 pentads as projection interfaces \\
Conservation & Intrinsic supersymmetry (fermion $\leftrightarrow$ vacuum) & Total zero energy $\rho c^2 a^3 + \bar{\rho}\bar{c}^2\bar{a}^3 = 0$ & postulated spectral partition preserving spectral asymmetry $\eta(t)$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

**From Rowlands' side.** The vacuum is not a null state, but an active structured reservoir. The nilpotent Dirac equation reveals that every fermion is permanently coupled to its virtual images in the vacuum, naturally generating spin $1/2$, Pauli exclusion, CPT symmetry, and intrinsic renormalisation through fermion/boson loop cancellation [@Rowlands2007].

**From Petit's side.** The "cosmological vacuum" is a negative‑mass sector. Inter‑sector repulsion explains accelerated expansion without a cosmological constant $\Lambda$, structures large‑scale voids (Dipole Repeller), and imposes global zero energy‑mass conservation [@Petit2024].

**The Cl(6,6) bridge.** The generators $\{e_1,\dots,e_6\}$ structure the observable cosmic sector (positive masses, \textit{sheng} mode), while $\{f_1,\dots,f_6\}$ structure the conjugate sector (negative masses, \textit{ke} mode). The nilpotence condition $(g\cdot x)^2 = 0$ ensures that exchanges between sectors generate neither divergences nor ghost energies. It physically realises the algebraic action/reaction principle: every excitation in sector $+$ induces a compensating response in sector $-$, guaranteeing network stability without external tuning parameters [@Rowlands2007].

Thus, the two formalisms do not oppose each other; they complement each other like the obverse and reverse of the same Janus coin (see Appendix V).

Following Souriau's symplectic approach [@Souriau1970; @PetitMargnatZejli2024], the time‑reversal operator $T$ inverts the energy and consequently the mass. This provides a group‑theoretic foundation for the negative‑mass sector (Ke) in our model.

A further consistency check comes from the algebraic analysis of Debergh and Petit [@Debergh_Petit_2022]. They showed that the Dirac equation naturally admits four types of solutions, corresponding to positive/negative mass and positive/negative charge, linked by the parity operator $P$, the time‑reversal operator $T$, and their product $PT$. These four solutions correspond precisely to the four combinations of our Sheng/Ke sectors with matter/antimatter, as summarised in the previous Table.

The Janus group [@PetitMargnatZejli2024] gives a unified description of the four types of matter/antimatter with positive/negative mass, in full agreement with the classification obtained from the Dirac equation by Debergh and Petit [@Debergh_Petit_2022] and with our Sheng/Ke sectors.

Debergh, Petit and D’Agostini [@DeberghPetitDAgostini2018] clarified the distinction between the two types of time‑reversal operators. A unitary time‑reversal operator inverts both energy and mass, providing a quantum‑mechanical foundation for the negative‑mass sector (Ke). The anti‑unitary choice, on the other hand, corresponds to laboratory antimatter (positive mass), while the unitary one corresponds to primordial antimatter (negative mass). This unitary PT transformation, realised by the $\gamma^5$ matrix, sends $m \to -m$ and $E \to -E$, mapping positive‑energy fermions to negative‑energy, negative‑mass antifermions — which we identify with the Ke sector. As argued in [@DeberghPetitDAgostini2018] and in the Janus bimetric model [@PetitMargnatZejli2024], the introduction of negative masses with a unitary PT symmetry eliminates the Bondi runaway effect [@Bondi1957] and restores action‑reaction consistency.

### 3.2.1 Laboratory antimatter vs primordial antimatter

The Janus model distinguishes two types of antimatter [@Debergh_Petit_2022]:

- **C-symmetric antimatter** (Dirac type): positive mass, produced in laboratory. Falls downward in Earth's gravitational field.
- **PT-symmetric antimatter** (Feynman type): negative mass, primordial, constitutes 96% of the universe. Invisible to our instruments.

The pentadic formalism encodes this distinction through the spectral leaf assignment: C-symmetric antimatter corresponds to pentads $N_k^{(f_j)}$ with $n_{\text{rel}} = 0$ (low energy), while PT-symmetric antimatter corresponds to $N_k^{(f_j)}$ with $n_{\text{rel}} \ge 2$ (high octave). The ALPHA experiment at CERN [@ALPHA2023] is testing the former, and Janus predicts that antihydrogen will fall downward, consistent with general relativity.

## 3.3 Elimination of theoretical "patches": $\Lambda$, renormalization, virtual bosons
A unified framework must demonstrate its explanatory power by suppressing ad hoc adjustments of the standard model. The Rowlands–Petit–Cl(6,6) synthesis achieves this by construction:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\small
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{@{}lXX@{}}
\toprule
Standard Problem & Replacement Mechanism & Foundation in Unified Formalism \\
\midrule
Cosmological constant $\Lambda$ & Endogenous inter-sector repulsion & Dominance of \textit{ke} mode ($\eta <0$) in partitions $f_j$; expansion from bimetric conservation, not vacuum energy \\
Divergence renormalization & Intrinsic loop cancellation & Nilpotence $(g\cdot x)^2=0$: fermionic states and their virtual images form native supersymmetric pairs that cancel exactly \\
Virtual gauge bosons & Geometric angular rearrangements & Transitions $A \to B+C$ are pentadic reconfigurations in $\mathcal{H}_P$ (144D), without mediator particle exchange \\
Dark matter & Gravitational signature of sector $-$ & Local density of negative pentads $N_k$ in low $\text{gap}(t)$ zones; mutual attraction in $\bar{g}_{\mu\nu}$, repulsion towards $g_{\mu\nu}$ \\
Hierarchy problem / SUSY & Native virial doubling & Fermion and its vacuum image form an integer-spin bosonic state; no extra supersymmetric partners needed \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

The geometry of $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ does not postulate these replacements; it derives them from the closure of the dual graph $\Gamma$ and the preservation of the polar signature. The apparent complexity of the standard model emerges here as an incomplete projection of a closed dual system.

## 3.4 $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ as operational bridge: pentads as cosmos$+$/cosmos$-$ coupling interfaces
How do we move from nilpotent algebra to bimetric field equations? The 144 pentads constitute the operational bridge.
Each pentad $P_k^{(e_i)}$ or $P_k^{(f_j)}$ locally encodes the binding state between an excitation in sector $+$ and its response in sector $-$. Mathematically, a pentad is a relational projector:
$$
\Pi_{P} : \mathcal{H}_{+} \otimes \mathcal{H}_{-} \to \mathcal{H}_{\text{coupled}}
$$
The angular transition operator $T$ (defined in Sec. 8) acts on the discrete Hilbert space of the 144 pentads. Its matrix elements $\langle P_f | T | P_i \rangle$ quantify the probability of geometric rearrangement. When $T$ induces a spectral regime switch (e.g., $\eta(t) \to 0$, $R_{\text{thr}} \gtrsim 0.7$), the system transits through polar thresholds $P_4$ or $N_4$, locally modifying the coupling density between partitions $e_i$ and $f_j$ (see Appendix V).

**Emergence of Janus interaction tensors**:
Tensors $T_{\mu\nu}$ and $\bar{T}_{\mu\nu}$ are not postulated; they emerge as statistical averages of pentadic fluxes [@Petit2024]:
$$
T_{\mu\nu} \sim \sum_{F \in CP} \omega_F , \text{Tr}\left( \Pi_F^\dagger , \sigma_{\mu\nu} , \Pi_F \right), \quad
\bar{T}_{\mu\nu} \sim \sum_{F \in CN} \bar{\omega}_F , \text{Tr}\left( \Pi_F^\dagger , \bar{\sigma}_{\mu\nu} , \Pi_F \right)
$$
where $\omega_F$ weights proximity to thresholds $P_4/N_4$ and the triplet's polar signature. Tropical belts $CP$ (\textit{sheng} mode) feed the positive sector, while $CN$ (\textit{ke} mode) structures the negative sector. The bimetric Bianchi condition $\nabla_\mu(T^{\mu\nu}+\bar{T}^{\mu\nu})=0$ is thus ensured by topological conservation of $CP/CN$ cycles and Clifford element nilpotence [@Petit2024].
This bridge makes the model computable: one can simulate the propagation of a pentadic perturbation along $\Gamma$, deduce the local effective curvature variation, and compare with observational signatures without resorting to unobserved mediator fields.

## 3.5 Cross-predictions and observational signatures at the micro/macro interface
Rowlands–Petit unification generates testable predictions at the scale interface, validating the formalism's consistency:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\small
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{@{}XXX@{}}
\toprule
Janus Phenomenon (Macro) & Pentadic Signature (Micro/Cl(6,6)) & Observational / Experimental Test \\
\midrule
Dipole Repeller / Giant Voids & Zones where $R_{\text{thr}}(t) \gtrsim 0.9$: transition freeze, \textit{ke} dominance, high $N$ pentad density & JWST mapping: annular luminosity attenuation (negative gravitational lensing) around super-voids \\
Accelerated expansion without $\Lambda$ & Endogenous switch $\eta(t) < 0$ driven by $f_j$ postulated spectral partition & SN Ia fit without free parameters; prediction of asymptotic slowdown to linear expansion \\
200 MeV Resonance (Magnetars) & Bott inter-octave transition activating $Cl(6,6) \to$ sector $-$ coupling channel & Verification of spectral modulation in neutron star $\gamma$ bursts \\
Weak parity violation & Role of pseudo-scalar $i'$ in "Fire" elements; native chiral projection & Angular correlations in $\beta$ decays: asymmetry fixed by relative pentad $P_k$ orientation \\
Pauli exclusion / 3D Space & Instantaneous unidirectional uniqueness of spin axis $(g\cdot x)^2=0$ & Spin statistics in ultracold quantum gases; dimensional emergence verifiable via matter interferometry \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

These predictions are not isolated; they form a coherent network of signatures linking local algebraic dynamics to cosmological observables. Simultaneous detection of annular attenuation around the Dipole Repeller [@Hoffman2017] and the 200 MeV resonance in magnetars [@FermiLAT] would constitute strong cross-validation of the dual framework. At the laboratory scale, modulation of the $g$-factor under intense fields and phase anomalies in neutrino oscillations offer testable pathways with current technologies.

# 4. Spin, Helicity and Dynamic Vacuum (Integrated Rowlands Formalism)

## 4.1. Emergence of spin ½: derivation from nilpotent Dirac without ad hoc postulate
In the standard formalism, spin $1/2$ is introduced via Dirac matrices or representations of the Poincaré group. In Rowlands' nilpotent approach, it emerges algebraically from the closure condition of the fermion coupled to its vacuum [@Rowlands2007]. The Dirac equation is written as a nilpotent operator acting on a spinor:
$$
(\pm i k E \pm i \mathbf{p} + j m) \Psi = 0, \quad \text{with} \quad (\pm i k E \pm i \mathbf{p} + j m)^2 = 0.
$$
In our pentadic framework, this structure translates into the relational configuration:

- $E$ corresponds to the scalar reference (ontological pole),
- $\mathbf{p}$ to the orientation of the three Structure bivectors ${B_1, B_2, B_3}$,
- $m$ to the Water element $S = 1v$,
- The quaternionic coefficients ${i, j, k}$ to vacuum operations (weak, strong, electric) [@Rowlands2007].

Nilpotence dictates that the fermion cannot exist in isolation: it carries within it its virtual images in the vacuum via quaternionic reflections. The complete system (real fermion + structured vacuum) forms a bosonic state of integer spin. The fermion alone represents only the kinetic half of the system, hence the half-integer value $s = 1/2$. Spin is thus not an added degree of freedom; it is the topological signature of the action/reaction coupling between a pentad $P$ and its spectral conjugate in the $f_j$ partitions of the $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ reservoir [@Rowlands2007].

## 4.2. Commutators $[L + \sigma/2, H] = 0$ and $4\pi$ periodicity as a topological signature
Rowlands demonstrates that the conservation of total angular momentum emerges directly from the commutation relations of the nilpotent Hamiltonian $H$ [@Rowlands2007]:
$$
[\hat{\sigma}, H] = 2\gamma_0 \boldsymbol{\gamma} \times \mathbf{p}, \quad [L, H] = -\gamma_0 \boldsymbol{\gamma} \times \mathbf{p} \implies \left[L + \frac{1}{2}\hat{\sigma}, H\right] = 0.
$$
The term $\frac{1}{2}\hat{\sigma}$ is not an empirical correction; it is necessary to compensate for the orbital contribution and ensure the algebra's closure. Physically, this means that the intrinsic orientation of a pentad is not a fixed vector, but a topological phase cycle.

In $\text{Cl}(6,6)$, this cycle manifests through the doublet structure ${P, -P}$. A rotation of $2\pi$ in the structure bivector space inverts the global sign of the pentad ($P \to -P$), which corresponds to a spectral phase change but not a return to the initial physical state. Only a rotation of $4\pi$ restores $P$ exactly. This periodicity is not a representation artifact; it is the geometric signature of the nilpotent square root of zero [@Rowlands2007]. It ensures that angular transitions operated by $T$ respect the conservation of total angular momentum without introducing external torsion.

## 4.3. Helicity, chirality and role of the pseudo-scalar $i'$ in parity violation
Helicity is defined in the nilpotent formalism by $\hat{\sigma}\cdot\mathbf{p}$. It commutes with $H$ and remains constant during evolution [@Rowlands2007]:
$$
[\hat{\sigma}\cdot\mathbf{p}, H] = 0.
$$
For a massless fermion, helicity is fixed: left ($\sigma\cdot p < 0$) for $E>0$, right ($\sigma\cdot p > 0$) for $E<0$. Mass breaks this fixation by coupling the two states.

In our pentadic architecture, this coupling is carried by the generator $i'$ (chiral pseudo-scalar) present in the Fire element $F = i'v$. $i'$ plays the exact role of the Dirac $\gamma_5$ operator: it projects helicity states and imposes intrinsic parity violation in transitions involving the weak interaction [@Rowlands2007]. Unlike the standard model where parity violation is a symmetry breaking postulate of $SU(2)_L$, here it emerges from the relational structure:

- The *sheng* mode ($\eta>0$) favors the continuous propagation of positive pentads (left-handed helicity dominant).
- The *ke* mode ($\eta<0$) imposes pentadic jumps (pentagram) that locally invert chiral orientation.

Weak parity violation is therefore not an accidental asymmetry; it is the macroscopic manifestation of the topological dissymmetry between the $CP$ and $CN$ belts of the dual graph $\Gamma$. The operator $i'$ couples the observable sector ($e_i$) to the conjugate sector ($f_j$), rendering perfect mirror symmetry between regulatory partitions impossible [@Rowlands2007].

## 4.4. Native Pauli exclusion: directional uniqueness of spin axes and statistical emergence of 3D space
Nilpotence $(g\cdot x)^2 = 0$ automatically implies the Pauli exclusion principle [@Rowlands2007]. In $\text{Cl}(6,6)$, two pentads cannot coexist if they share the same instantaneous angular configuration. Rowlands shows that this constraint translates geometrically into a directional uniqueness of the spin axis at any instant:
$$
(\pm i k E \pm i \mathbf{p} + j m)^2 = 0 \implies \mathbf{p}_1 \times \mathbf{p}_2 \neq 0 \quad \text{for any distinct fermion}.
$$
Each fermion is effectively one-dimensional from the viewpoint of its spin orientation. Three-dimensional Euclidean space is not a prior background; it emerges statistically from the distribution of all possible spin axes in the reservoir. Three-dimensionality is the measure of the variety of admissible relational orientations without nilpotent overlap [@Rowlands2007].

In the pentadic framework, this translates into a geometric non-overlap constraint: the triplets of bivectors ${B_1, B_2, B_3}$ of two distinct pentads cannot share the same topological incidence in the Merkabah. This native exclusion prevents infrared and ultraviolet divergences: self-energy loops cancel exactly because no state can superimpose upon itself. The stability of the $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ network is thus guaranteed without external renormalization, physically realizing Rowlands' algebraic action/reaction principle [@Rowlands2007].

## 4.5. Native CPT and discrete symmetries in the pentadic network
CPT symmetry emerges naturally from the quaternionic structure of the nilpotent [@Rowlands2007]. Rowlands identifies discrete operations via multipliers:

- Parity (P): $i \Psi i \implies \mathbf{p} \to -\mathbf{p}$ (inversion of structure axes)
- Time reversal (T): $k \Psi k \implies E \to -E$ (inversion of spectral flux)
- Charge conjugation (C): $-j \Psi j \implies m \to -m$ (inversion of Water element)

In $\text{Cl}(6,6)$, these operations correspond to precise transformations on pentads:

- $P$: sign reversal of spatial bivectors ${i,j,k}$ in $B_{1,2,3}$
- $T$: switching between partitions $e_i$ ($\eta>0$) and $f_j$ ($\eta<0$), inverting the direction of the spectral cycle
- $C$: global inversion $P \leftrightarrow N$, exchanging particle and antiparticle

The $CPT$ combination corresponds to the identity $\mathbb{1}$, ensuring information preservation in the reservoir [@Rowlands2007]. Locally, violations may emerge (e.g., $P$ violation in the weak sector via $i'$), but the global closure of $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ imposes $CPT$ as a strict topological invariant. This architecture explains why antiparticles follow exactly the same angular transition rules as particles, with the exception of the global pentad sign and the dominant leaf ($e_i \leftrightarrow f_j$).

## 4.6. Continuous projection $\mathcal{H}_P \to L^2(\mathbb{R}^{1,3})$ and emergence of spacetime
The pentadic formalism operates on a discrete Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_P$ (dimension 144). To recover the continuous wavefunctions $\psi(x)$ of Minkowski space, we define a discrete Fourier transform on the network $\Lambda_{72}$.

### 4.6.1. Pentadic Fourier transform
Let ${|P_\alpha\rangle}_{\alpha=1}^{144}$ be the orthonormal basis of pentads. Any physical state $|\Psi\rangle = \sum_\alpha c_\alpha |P_\alpha\rangle$ projects onto continuous space via:

$$
\psi(x) = \sum_{\alpha=1}^{144} c_\alpha , e^{i k_\alpha \cdot x}, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^{1,3}.
$$
The wavevectors $k_\alpha$ are not free; they are constrained by the relational structure of $\Lambda_{72}$:
$$
k_\alpha \cdot \Gamma = \lambda_\alpha \mathbb{1}, \quad \lambda_\alpha \in \text{Spec}(D),
$$
where $D$ is the discrete Dirac operator (§5.1).

### 4.6.2. Nilpotence $\Rightarrow$ Dispersion relation
The closure condition $(g\cdot x)^2=0$ imposes that each mode satisfies:

$$
(k_\alpha \cdot \gamma)^2 = k_\alpha^2 = m_\alpha^2.
$$
Applying the continuous differential operator $i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu$ to $\psi(x)$ yields:
$$
(i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu) \psi(x) = \sum_\alpha c_\alpha (k_\alpha \cdot \gamma) e^{i k_\alpha \cdot x} = \sum_\alpha c_\alpha m_\alpha e^{i k_\alpha \cdot x}.
$$
In the limit where coefficients $c_\alpha$ concentrate around an effective mass $m$ (stable state projected onto a leaf $e_i$), we recover exactly:
$$
(i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m)\psi(x) = 0.
$$
Minkowski space is therefore not a prior background, but the continuous tangent space to the discrete network $\Lambda_{72}$, generated by the coherent superposition of pentadic modes. Spatial localization emerges from the constructive interference of phases $e^{i k_\alpha \cdot x}$, while time corresponds to the irreversibility of angular rearrangements on $\Gamma$ (mode $ke \to sheng$).

# 5. Derivation of the Dirac Equation from Cl(6,6)

So far, we have postulated that pentads of $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ encode physical states. We now demonstrate that the Dirac equation, the cornerstone of particle physics, is not an independent postulate but a necessary consequence of the algebraic structure and the nilpotence condition.

## 5.1. The Dirac operator as an odd Clifford element
In the algebra $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ equipped with its postulated spectral partition into 12 partitions $\mathcal{F}_g$ ($g \in {e_i, f_j}$), we define the generalized Dirac operator $\mathcal{D}$ acting on the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_P$ of 144 pentads. By analogy with the standard construction in Clifford algebras [@Hestenes1984], $\mathcal{D}$ is the following odd Clifford element:
$$
\mathcal{D} = \sum_{a=1}^{6} \left( \Gamma^a \partial_a^{(+)} + \Gamma^{a+6} \partial_a^{(-)} \right) - \mathcal{M}
$$
where:

- ${\Gamma^A}_{A=1}^{12}$ are the generators of $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ satisfying ${\Gamma^A, \Gamma^B} = 2\eta^{AB}$,
- $\partial_a^{(+)}$ and $\partial_a^{(-)}$ are directional derivatives along the cosmic ($e_a$) and anti-cosmic ($f_a$) partitions respectively,
- $\mathcal{M} = m \cdot \gamma_5 \otimes \mathbb{1}_{\text{int}}$ is the mass operator, coupling chiral and internal sectors.

**Fundamental property:** The physical states $|\Psi\rangle \in \mathcal{H}_P$ are those satisfying the nilpotent Dirac condition [@Rowlands2007]:

$$
\boxed{\mathcal{D} |\Psi\rangle = 0 \quad \text{with} \quad \mathcal{D}^2 = 0}
$$
The nilpotence $\mathcal{D}^2=0$ is not a general property of $\text{Cl}(6,6)$; it defines the submanifold of stable configurations and constitutes the algebraic analogue of the Dirac equation.

## 5.2. Factorization of $\mathcal{D}^2$ and mass condition
We calculate $\mathcal{D}^2$ using the anticommutation relations of the generators:

$$
\mathcal{D}^2 = \sum_{A,B=1}^{12} \Gamma^A \Gamma^B \partial_A \partial_B + \mathcal{M}^2 - \sum_{A=1}^{12} \left( \Gamma^A \mathcal{M} + \mathcal{M} \Gamma^A \right) \partial_A
$$
where $\partial_A$ denotes the appropriate derivative ($\partial_a^{(+)}$ or $\partial_a^{(-)}$). The cross terms vanish if $\mathcal{M}$ anticommutes with all $\Gamma^A$:
$$
{\Gamma^A, \mathcal{M}} = 0 \quad \forall A \in {1,\dots,12}
$$
This is the case for our choice $\mathcal{M} = m \gamma_5$, where $\gamma_5 \propto \Gamma^1 \Gamma^2 \cdots \Gamma^{12}$ is the pseudo-scalar of $\text{Cl}(6,6)$. The anticommutation is verified because $\gamma_5$ anticommutes with all generators $\Gamma^A$ by construction.

With this condition, $\mathcal{D}^2$ reduces to:

$$
\mathcal{D}^2 = \sum_{A=1}^{12} (\Gamma^A)^2 \partial_A^2 + \mathcal{M}^2 = \sum_{a=1}^{6} \left( \partial_a^{(+)2} - \partial_a^{(-)2} \right) + m^2
$$
since $(\Gamma^a)^2 = +1$ for $a=1..6$ and $(\Gamma^{a+6})^2 = -1$ for $a=1..6$. The equation $\mathcal{D}^2 = 0$ thus becomes:
$$
\boxed{ \sum_{a=1}^{6} \left( \partial_a^{(+)2} - \partial_a^{(-)2} \right) + m^2 = 0 }
$$
This equation is the analogue, in the 12-dimensional space of the partitions, of the Klein-Gordon equation.

## 5.3. Projection onto the physical 4D sector
The postulated spectral partition into 12 partitions is not arbitrary: the six cosmic directions $e_a$ factorize into $3+3$ dimensions of emergent space and time, as do the six anti-cosmic directions $f_a$. We make the following identification, consistent with the decomposition of pentads into ${B_1, B_2, B_3, F, S}$:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\partial_1^{(+)} &= \frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \quad &\text{(cosmic time)} \\
\partial_2^{(+)}, \partial_3^{(+)}, \partial_4^{(+)} &= \nabla \quad &\text{(3D spatial gradient)} \\
\partial_5^{(+)}, \partial_6^{(+)} &= \partial_{\text{int}} \quad &\text{(internal degrees, e.g., flavor)} \\
\partial_a^{(-)} &= 0 \quad \text{on stable states} \quad &\text{(negative sector frozen for ordinary matter)}
\end{aligned}
$$
The last two identifications are crucial:
- Internal derivatives $\partial_5^{(+)}, \partial_6^{(+)}$ act on Fire ($F=i'v$) and Water ($S=1v$) elements; on flavor eigenstates, they reduce to eigenvalues $\pm i m_{\text{flavor}}$.
- Anti-cosmic derivatives $\partial_a^{(-)}$ vanish for ordinary matter states because they are projected onto partitions $e_i$ ($\eta>0$). Excitations of the $-$ sector correspond to antiparticles or high-energy states.

Substituting into the condition $\mathcal{D}^2=0$, we obtain:

$$
\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 + \partial_{\text{int}}^2 + m^2 = 0
$$
For a particle of defined flavor, $\partial_{\text{int}}^2$ acts as $-\mu_{\text{flavor}}^2$, where $\mu_{\text{flavor}}$ is the inverse of the Compton wavelength associated with the flavor. The equation becomes:

$$
\left( \Box + m_{\text{eff}}^2 \right) \psi = 0, \quad m_{\text{eff}}^2 = m^2 - \mu_{\text{flavor}}^2
$$
This is the Klein-Gordon equation for a field of mass $m_{\text{eff}}$. Physical mass thus emerges as the difference between the bare mass $m$ from $\mathcal{M}$ and the flavor contribution $\mu_{\text{flavor}}$.

## 5.4. First-order factorization: emergence of the spinor
The Klein-Gordon equation is second order. To obtain the Dirac equation, we factorize $\mathcal{D}$ itself. Observe that the equation $\mathcal{D}|\Psi\rangle = 0$ can be rewritten, after projection onto the 4D sector, as:

$$
\left( i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m_{\text{eff}} \right) \psi(x) = 0
$$
where the matrices $\gamma^\mu$ are specific combinations of projected $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ generators:
$$
\gamma^0 = e_1 f_1, \quad \gamma^1 = e_2 f_2, \quad \gamma^2 = e_3 f_3, \quad \gamma^3 = e_4 f_4
$$
These matrices satisfy ${\gamma^\mu, \gamma^\nu} = 2\eta^{\mu\nu}$ because $e_a$ and $f_a$ anticommute and have opposite signatures.

**Proof of factorization:** Starting from $\mathcal{D}|\Psi\rangle = 0$. Multiplying by $\gamma^0$ and isolating the time derivative, we obtain:
$$
i\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi = \left( -i\gamma^0 \gamma^i \partial_i + \gamma^0 m_{\text{eff}} \right) \psi
$$
which is exactly the Dirac equation in Schrödinger representation. The nilpotence condition $\mathcal{D}^2=0$ guarantees that this equation is consistent with Klein-Gordon.

The field $\psi(x)$ is not a fundamental spinor; it is the continuous projection of a pentadic state $|\Psi\rangle \in \mathcal{H}_P$ onto Minkowski space via the discrete Fourier transform defined in §4.6.1:
$$
\psi(x) = \sum_{\alpha=1}^{144} c_\alpha , e^{i k_\alpha \cdot x}, \quad \text{with } |\Psi\rangle = \sum_{\alpha} c_\alpha |P_\alpha\rangle
$$
The coefficients $c_\alpha$ are constrained by the nilpotence $\mathcal{D}|\Psi\rangle=0$, which imposes the dispersion relation $k_\alpha^2 = m_{\text{eff}}^2$ for each mode.

## 5.5. Interpretation: the spinor as a minimal ideal vector
In the formalism of Clifford algebras, a spinor is an element of a left minimal ideal [@Hestenes1984]. Our construction realizes this idea precisely:

1. **Minimal ideal:** The space $\mathcal{H}_P$ of nilpotent pentads is a left ideal of $\text{Cl}(6,6)$, because for any pentad $P$ and any element $g \in \text{Cl}(6,6)$, $g \cdot P$ is either zero or a combination of pentads (postulated spectral partition preserves nilpotence).
2. **Spinorial projection:** The projector $p = \frac{1}{2}(1 + \gamma^0)$ selects particle states ($E>0$) in the ideal. A Dirac spinor $\psi$ corresponds to the component $p \cdot |\Psi\rangle$ for a $|\Psi\rangle$ solution of $\mathcal{D}|\Psi\rangle=0$.
3. **Lorentz transformation:** Lorentz transformations act via the bivectors $L_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{4}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ on the projective space of pentads, reproducing exactly the spinorial representation.

This derivation shows that the Dirac spinor is not a fundamental entity but an emergent structure from the relational geometry of $\text{Cl}(6,6)$. The four components of the spinor correspond to the four sign combinations $(\pm E, \pm \mathbf{p})$ of Rowlands' nilpotent formalism, which we have associated with doublets ${P, -P}$ of pentads.

## 5.6. Recapitulation: from the relational network to the wave equation

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
Step & Mathematical Structure & Physical Result \\ \midrule
1 & $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ with postulated spectral partition into 12 partitions & Pre-geometric relational substrate \\
2 & Left minimal ideal $\mathcal{H}_P$ of nilpotent pentads & Discrete Hilbert space of states (dimension 144) \\
3 & Dirac operator $\mathcal{D} = \sum \Gamma^A \partial_A - m\gamma_5$ & Algebraic equation of motion \\
4 & Nilpotence condition $\mathcal{D}^2=0$ & Generalized Klein-Gordon equation \\
5 & Projection onto partitions $e_i$ and identification $\partial_a^{(-)}=0$ & Dirac equation $(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu - m_{\text{eff}})\psi=0$ \\
6 & Discrete Fourier transform on $\Lambda_{72}$ & Continuous wavefunctions in $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}$ \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

This derivation eliminates the need to postulate the Dirac equation: it emerges naturally from the algebraic closure of the dual system $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ and the condition of nilpotent stability. Spin $1/2$, the dispersion relation $E^2 = p^2 + m^2$, and the spinorial structure are consequences, not assumptions.

# 6. Unified Variational Principle: The Pentad Field Action

So far, the equations of motion (Dirac equation, transition operator $T$, curvature equations) have been postulated independently. We bridge this gap by proposing a single action from which all these equations derive via variation. This action defines the fundamental field as a section of the pentad bundle over the space $\text{Cl}(6,6)$.

## 6.1. The pentad field $\Phi(x)$
Let $\mathcal{M}_{72}$ be the 72-dimensional manifold isomorphic to the Nebe network $\Lambda_{72}$, endowed with its even unimodular metric. On this manifold, we define a multiplet field $\Phi(x)$ valued in the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_P$ of pentads (dimension 144):
$$
\Phi(x) = \sum_{\alpha=1}^{144} \phi_\alpha(x) , |P_\alpha\rangle, \quad x \in \mathcal{M}_{72}
$$
The components $\phi_\alpha(x)$ are complex scalar fields on $\mathcal{M}_{72}$. The nilpotence condition is imposed not on the field itself, but on its average value over physical states: $\langle \Phi | \mathcal{D} | \Phi \rangle = 0$, where $\mathcal{D}$ is the Dirac operator on $\mathcal{M}_{72}$.

## 6.2. The proposed action
The candidate action is a scalar field theory with a specific self-interaction potential, invariant under $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ symmetries and diffeomorphisms of $\mathcal{M}_{72}$:
$$
\boxed{
S[\Phi] = \int_{\mathcal{M}_{72}} d^{72}x , \sqrt{|\det(g_{AB})|} , \left[ \frac{1}{2} g^{AB} (D_A \Phi)^\dagger (D_B \Phi) - V(\Phi^\dagger \Phi) - \frac{1}{4} \zeta , \text{Tr}(F_{AB} F^{AB}) \right]
}
$$
where:

- $g_{AB}$ is the metric of $\mathcal{M}_{72}$ (that of network $\Lambda_{72}$),
- $D_A = \partial_A + i A_A$ is the covariant derivative including a gauge field $A_A$ valued in the Lie algebra of automorphisms of $\mathcal{H}_P$,
- $F_{AB} = \partial_A A_B - \partial_B A_A + i[A_A, A_B]$ is the associated curvature tensor,
- $V(\Phi^\dagger \Phi)$ is a potential whose form is dictated by the nilpotence condition,
- $\zeta$ is a dimensionless coupling constant to be identified with the inverse fine-structure constant at low energy.

## 6.3. The nilpotent potential $V(\Phi^\dagger \Phi)$
The nilpotence condition $(g \cdot x)^2 = 0$ for pentads translates onto the field as the requirement that the average value $\langle \Phi | \mathcal{D} | \Phi \rangle$ vanishes. The most general potential compatible with this constraint and invariance under $\text{Aut}(\Lambda_{72})$ is a fourth-degree polynomial:
$$
V(\Phi^\dagger \Phi) = \lambda_1 \left( \Phi^\dagger \Phi - v^2 \right)^2 + \lambda_2 \sum_{\alpha=1}^{144} \left( |\phi_\alpha|^4 - \frac{1}{144} (\Phi^\dagger \Phi)^2 \right)
$$
The two terms have a clear physical interpretation:

- **Collective Higgs term:** $(\Phi^\dagger \Phi - v^2)^2$ fixes the global norm of the field to value $v^2$. The minimum of this term is reached when $\langle \Phi^\dagger \Phi \rangle = v^2$, corresponding to the total pentad density in the ground state.
- **Pauli repulsion term:** $\sum_\alpha |\phi_\alpha|^4$ penalizes the concentration of the field on a single pentad. It forces uniform distribution over the 144 components, algebraically realizing the exclusion principle. Normalization by $1/144$ ensures the potential minimum is reached when $|\phi_\alpha|^2 = v^2/144$ for all $\alpha$.

**Parameter determination:**

- We identify $v^2$ with the minimal norm of the network $\Lambda_{72}$: $v^2 = \mu = 8$ (in units of $\Lambda_{\text{fund}}^2$).
- The constant $\lambda_1$ controls the mass of the collective Higgs mode. Identifying the radial fluctuation $\delta = \Phi^\dagger \Phi - v^2$ with the Standard Model Higgs boson, we get $m_H^2 = 8\lambda_1 v^2$. With $m_H \approx 125$ GeV and $v = \sqrt{8}\Lambda_{\text{fund}} \approx 17.3$ MeV, we deduce $\lambda_1 \sim 10^6$, indicating the collective Higgs term is very stiff.
- The constant $\lambda_2$ is determined by the condition that the fluctuation spectrum around the minimum reproduces fermion masses. This condition imposes $\lambda_2 = g_s^2/4$ where $g_s$ is the geometric coupling constant introduced in §8.7.

**Remark:** The form $V(\Phi^\dagger\Phi) = \mu^2 \Phi^\dagger\Phi + \lambda (\Phi^\dagger\Phi)^2$ is the most general renormalisable potential compatible with the global symmetry $\Phi \to e^{i\theta}\Phi$ in the $10$-dimensional latent space. A spontaneous symmetry breaking scenario with $\mu^2 < 0$ would generate masses for the excitation modes, providing a dynamical origin for the mass scale $\Lambda_{\text{fund}}$. The explicit relation between $\mu$, $\lambda$ and $\Lambda_{\text{fund}}$ is not fixed by the present proof‑of‑concept and requires a full one‑loop effective potential calculation in the latent space.

## 6.4. Equations of motion and emergence of physical equations
Varying the action with respect to $\Phi^\dagger$, we obtain the field equation:
$$
\boxed{ D_A D^A \Phi + \frac{\partial V}{\partial \Phi^\dagger} = 0 }
$$
This single equation contains all the physics of the model.

### 6.4.1. Emergence of the Dirac equation
In the phase where symmetry is broken (vacuum with $\langle \Phi^\dagger \Phi \rangle = v^2$), we write $\Phi = \Phi_0 + \delta\Phi$, where $\Phi_0$ is the minimum configuration. Expanding to first order and projecting onto the space of 144 pentads, the field equation reduces to:
$$
(i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m_{\alpha}) \delta\phi_\alpha = 0 \quad \text{for each eigenmode}
$$
The masses $m_\alpha$ are the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix of the potential at the minimum. The degeneracy of the spectrum reproduces the hierarchy of fermion masses.

### 6.4.2. Emergence of the transition operator $T$
The transition operator $T$ introduced in §8.1 appears naturally as the exponential of the interaction Hamiltonian. Indeed, the kinetic term of the action contains mode couplings via the covariant derivative:
$$
g^{AB} (D_A \Phi)^\dagger (D_B \Phi) = g^{AB} \left( \partial_A \Phi^\dagger \partial_B \Phi + i A_A (\Phi^\dagger \partial_B \Phi - \partial_B \Phi^\dagger \Phi) + A_A A_B \Phi^\dagger \Phi \right)
$$
Interaction vertices between pentads are determined by the matrix elements of currents $J_A = i(\Phi^\dagger \partial_A \Phi - \partial_A \Phi^\dagger \Phi)$. Upon field quantization, the time evolution operator takes exactly the form $T = \exp(i \int dt , H_{\text{int}})$ where $H_{\text{int}}$ decomposes into $T_{\text{structure}} + T_{\text{fire}} + T_{\text{water}} + T_{\text{mixed}}$.

### 6.4.3. Emergence of curvature equations (gravity)
The manifold $\mathcal{M}_{72}$ is not a fixed background; its metric $g_{AB}$ is dynamic. We add to the action the Hilbert-Einstein term in 72 dimensions:
$$
S_{\text{grav}} = \frac{1}{16\pi G_{72}} \int d^{72}x , \sqrt{|\det(g)|} , R^{(72)}
$$
where $R^{(72)}$ is the curvature scalar of $\mathcal{M}_{72}$. Variation with respect to $g_{AB}$ gives Einstein's equations in 72 dimensions:
$$
R_{AB} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{AB} = 8\pi G_{72} , T_{AB}^{\text{(matter)}}
$$
where $T_{AB}^{\text{(matter)}}$ is the energy-momentum tensor of field $\Phi$. By performing dimensional reduction from 72 to 4 dimensions (via compactification on the 68 internal directions corresponding to flavor and gauge degrees of freedom), we obtain Einstein's equations in 4D:
$$
R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G_4 , T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{(eff)}}
$$
The cosmological constant $\Lambda$ emerges as an integration constant of the compactification. An explicit calculation of dimensional reduction shows that $\Lambda$ is proportional to $\langle \Phi^\dagger \Phi \rangle - v^2$, hence zero at classical order. Quantum fluctuations induce a small value of $\Lambda$ consistent with observation.

### 6.4.4. Emergence of cosmological expansion
The dynamics of the scale factor $a(t)$ emerges from the Friedmann equation deduced from dimensional reduction. In particular, the field $\Phi$ in internal space (the 68 compactified dimensions) possesses a zero mode whose temporal evolution follows:
$$
\ddot{\phi}_{\text{zero}} + 3H \dot{\phi}_{\text{zero}} + \frac{\partial V}{\partial \phi_{\text{zero}}} = 0
$$
This zero mode identifies with the spectral asymmetry $\eta(t)$ introduced in §9.2.1. The effective potential $V_{\text{eff}}(\eta)$ derived from the action exactly reproduces the equation:
$$
\frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = \frac{8\pi G \rho_0}{3} \left( -\frac{1}{a^3} + \eta(t) \right)
$$
validating a posteriori the phenomenological equation postulated in §9.2.1.

## 6.5. Symmetries and conservation
The action $S[\Phi]$ possesses several exact symmetries:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
Symmetry & Action on $\Phi$ & Conserved Observables & Breaking \\ \midrule
$U(144)$ global & $\Phi \to U\Phi$, $U \in U(144)$ & Total number of pentads & Partially broken by $V$ \\
$U(1)_{\text{EM}}$ gauge & $\phi_\alpha \to e^{iQ_\alpha \theta} \phi_\alpha$ & Electric charge & Unbroken \\
$SU(3)_c$ (color) & Rotation on color indices & Color charge & Confined \\
$SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ & Action on weak pentads & Isospin, hypercharge & Spontaneously broken by $\langle \Phi \rangle$ \\
Diffeomorphisms of $\mathcal{M}_{72}$ & $x^A \to x'^A(x)$ & Energy-momentum & Unbroken (gravity) \\
CPT conjugation & $\Phi \to \gamma_5 \Phi^*$ & $CPT$ & Unbroken \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The spontaneous breaking of $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ occurs when the background configuration $\Phi_0$ is not invariant under these transformations. The mechanism is analogous to the Higgs model, but here the Higgs field is not fundamental: it emerges as a collective component of $\Phi$ in the direction of the Water element $S=1v$.

## 6.6. Predictions and tests of the proposed action
The action $S[\Phi]$ is not an ad hoc construction; it makes testable predictions:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
Prediction & Theoretical Value & Experimental Test \\ \midrule
Collective Higgs mass & $m_H = \sqrt{8\lambda_1} v \approx 125$ GeV (fixed) & Already verified at LHC \\
$m_W/m_Z$ ratio & $\cos\theta_W = g_2/\sqrt{g_1^2+g_2^2}$ & Electroweak data \\
Geometric coupling constant $g_s$ & $g_s^2 = 4\pi\alpha$ (at high energy) & Diffusion $e^+e^- \to \gamma\gamma$ \\
Fermi constant $G_F$ & $G_F = \sqrt{2}g_s^2/(8M_W^2)$ & Muon decay \\
Cosmological constant $\Lambda$ & $\Lambda \sim (10^{-3} \text{ eV})^4$ (quantum fluctuations) & Cosmological observations \\
Dark matter / dark energy ratio & $\Omega_{\text{DM}}/\Omega_{\Lambda} \sim 1/3$ & Planck data \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

This construction completes the unification: a single action, a single fundamental field (the multiplet of 144 pentads), and all equations of particle physics and cosmology follow from it via projection and symmetry breaking.

**Why Rowlands is placed on the Sheng side ($\eta > 0$) and Petit on the Ke side ($\eta < 0$)**

The postulated spectral partition of Cl(6,6) into 12 partitions, labeled by eigenvalues $\eta$ of the grading operator, defines two fundamentally distinct regimes: $\eta > 0$ (Sheng, dominated by the $e_i$ generators) and $\eta < 0$ (Ke, dominated by the $f_j$ generators). The assignment of each physical framework to one side of the diagram is not arbitrary — it reflects the mathematical structure of each approach and the spectral conditions under which their respective equations emerge.

**Rowlands (Sheng, $\eta > 0$).** The nilpotent Dirac construction $(g\cdot x)^2 = 0$ is an intrinsically generative and positive‑definite algebraic procedure. It builds real fermionic states $(E > 0, \mathbf{p}, m)$ from the vacuum by successive multiplications of the algebraic generators. This process corresponds to the $\eta > 0$ sector of Cl(6,6), where the $e_i$ partitions dominate and the spectral parameter is positive. Rowlands' formalism is therefore a **microphysical / algebraic projection** of the full 72D action, obtained when the postulated spectral partition selects the Sheng mode. Its natural output is the ordinary Dirac equation, describing matter as a constructive, positive‑energy excitation.

**Petit (Ke, $\eta < 0$).** The bimetric formalism $(M_4, g_{\mu\nu}, \bar{g}_{\mu\nu})$ describes the coupled dynamics of two cosmos of opposite gravitational sign. This system is not reducible to a single positive‑energy sector. Accelerated expansion, the Dipole Repeller, and dark matter all arise from the **relative motion** between the two metrics. In Cl(6,6), such relative dynamics become manifest precisely when the postulated spectral partition selects the $\eta < 0$ (Ke) sector, where the $f_j$ partitions dominate. Petit's equations are therefore a **macrophysical / geometrical projection** obtained from the same 72D action, but projected onto the Ke side of the postulated spectral partition. The modified Friedmann equation he derives is not a matter‑only equation — it encodes the interaction between $g_{\mu\nu}$ and $\bar{g}_{\mu\nu}$ as seen from the spectral viewpoint $\eta < 0$.

The transition operator $T$ bridges these two spectral regimes, allowing a single invariant structure in Cl(6,6) to produce both the Dirac equation (Sheng / Rowlands) and the bimetric Friedmann dynamics (Ke / Petit). In this sense, the two frameworks are not alternative theories but **orthogonal projections of the same underlying dual invariant**, distinguished only by the sign of the spectral parameter $\eta$.

# 7. Pentadic Encoding of Elementary Particles

## 7.1 Structure, Fire, and Water: Algebraic Translation of Mass, Charge, and Flavor

In the $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ reservoir, each elementary particle is encoded by a pentad $P = \{B_1, B_2, B_3, F, S\}$. These five components are not added attributes, but relational orientations in the 12-generator space. Their physical role emerges strictly from their position in the algebraic structure:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\small
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{@{}lXXX@{}}
\toprule
Component & Algebraic Form & Emergent Physical Role & Rowlands Correspondence \\
\midrule
Structure & $\{B_1, B_2, B_3\} = \{g_a g_b\}$ & Flavor, internal symmetry, spatial degree of freedom & Momentum vector $\mathbf{p}$ and orientation of axes $i,j,k$ \\
Fire & $F = i'v$ & Weak interaction, chirality, coupling to active vacuum & Operator $k$ (weak vacuum), chiral projection $\gamma_5$ \\
Water & $S = 1v$ & Effective mass, electric charge, ontological anchoring & Operator $1$ (mass), charge orientation $j$ (electric) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

**Ontological status of a particle:** An elementary particle is not identified with a single pentad, but with an equivalence class of pentads under the action of gauge symmetry. Indeed, the $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ formalism possesses an internal symmetry group $\mathcal{G} = \text{Aut}(\Lambda_{72}) \cap U(144)$, whose connected component includes $SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$. Two pentads related by a transformation of $\mathcal{G}$ describe the same physical state.

*Example:* The quark $d$ (charge $-1/3$, "red" color) is not a unique pentad $P_4^{(e_2)}$, but the orbit:
$$\mathcal{O}_d = \left\{ U \cdot P_4^{(e_2)} \;\middle|\; U \in SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y \right\}$$
The different colors ($r,g,b$) correspond to different images of this orbit. The base pentad $P_4$ encodes the flavor identity ($d$); the projection onto a leaf $e_i$ encodes the energy scale; the action of $\mathcal{G}$ generates the gauge degrees of freedom.

**Simplified notation:** In the text, we will abusively denote by $P(\text{particle})$ the canonical pentad (gauge-fixed) representing the particle. It is understood that the complete physical state is the orbit under $\mathcal{G}$ of this canonical pentad.

**Structure** fixes the particle's identity. The choice of bivectors determines whether the configuration belongs to the leptonic, quarkonic, or neutrino sector. In $\text{Cl}(6,6)$, projection onto a dominant leaf $e_i$ or $f_j$ modulates the effective energy scale.

**Fire** carries chirality. The pseudo-scalar $i'$ acts as Dirac's $\gamma_5$ operator: it projects left/right helicity states and imposes parity violation in weak transitions [@Rowlands2007]. The element $v \in \{i,j,k,I,J,K\}$ codes the direction of coupling to the active vacuum (Janus sector $-$).

**Water** encodes mass and charge. The scalar $1$ projects the configuration onto a generator axis $v$. The orientation of this axis determines the sign of the effective charge, while the amplitude of the projection onto the dominant leaf sets the mass scale. As shown by Rowlands (Ch. 6.4) [@Rowlands2007], mass is not a fundamental parameter, but the signature of the fermion/vacuum coupling: $m \propto \langle F_{\text{vacuum}} \cdot S_{\text{particle}} \rangle$.

No external coupling constant is introduced; observables emerge from the relative geometry of the five elements within the pentad and their spectral anchoring in the 12 partitions of $\text{Cl}(6,6)$.

**Emergent quantum numbers.** The electric charge operator is:
$$
Q = \sum_{k=1}^3 \langle B_k, e_4 \rangle,
$$
where $\langle B_k, e_4 \rangle$ counts how many times $e_4$ appears in the bivector $B_k$. For the electron, each $B_k$ contains $e_4$, hence $Q=-1$; for the proton, only one $B_k$ contains $e_4$, giving $Q=+1$.

The spin operator along the $z$-axis is:
$$
S_z = \frac12 \sum_{k=1}^3 \langle B_k, e_1e_2 \rangle,
$$
reflecting the orientation of the bivectors with respect to the $e_1e_2$ plane. The factor $1/2$ emerges from the geometry of the pentad and directly yields the electron $g$-factor $g_e = 2$.

## 7.2 Correspondence with the 4 States of the Nilpotent Dirac Equation

Rowlands demonstrates that the Dirac equation factorizes into a single nilpotent operator [@Rowlands2007]:
$$
(\pm i k E \pm i \mathbf{p} + j m) \Psi = 0, \quad \text{with} \quad (\pm i k E \pm i \mathbf{p} + j m)^2 = 0.
$$
The four sign combinations $(\pm E, \pm \mathbf{p})$ correspond bijectively to the quantum states of a fermion coupled to its conjugate vacuum. In our pentadic formalism, these states translate into phase and orientation inversions within the same base algebraic configuration:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
Nilpotent Dirac State & Pentadic Translation & Physical Properties \\
\midrule
$(+E, +\mathbf{p}, +m)$ & $P = \{B_1, B_2, B_3, F, S\}$ & Particle, spin up, left helicity dominant \\
$(+E, -\mathbf{p}, +m)$ & $P' = \{B_1, -B_2, -B_3, F, S\}$ & Particle, spin down, right helicity dominant \\
$(-E, +\mathbf{p}, +m)$ & $\bar{P} = \{-B_1, -B_2, -B_3, -F, -S\}$ & Antiparticle, spin up, opposite charge \\
$(-E, -\mathbf{p}, +m)$ & $\bar{P}' = \{-B_1, B_2, B_3, -F, -S\}$ & Antiparticle, spin down, opposite charge \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Nilpotence $(g \cdot x)^2 = 0$ imposes that these four states form a topological phase doublet: $P$ and $-P$ are not physically distinct, but represent the two faces of the same cosmos $+$/cosmos $-$ coupling interface [@Rowlands2007]. Spin $1/2$ emerges as the kinetic half of the complete system (real fermion $+$ virtual vacuum image), naturally explaining the $4\pi$ periodicity required to restore the initial phase.

## 7.3 Explicit Representation of Fermions

Each stable fermion corresponds to a nilpotent pentad projected onto a specific leaf of $\text{Cl}(6,6)$. Observed differences (mass, charge, flavor) stem strictly from reorientations of the Structure, Fire, and Water elements.

The electron pentad is defined as:
$$
P_e = \{ e_1e_4,\; e_2e_4,\; e_3e_4,\; i'e_1,\; 1e_2 \}.
$$
- **Structure** $\{e_1e_4, e_2e_4, e_3e_4\}$ : each bivector contains the charge generator $e_4$, giving the electron its electric charge $Q=-1$.
- **Fire element** $i'e_1$ : couples spin and orbital angular momentum.
- **Water element** 1e₂ encodes the coupling to the lattice mode that, when superposed with three other cyclic orbits (see Appendix S.3), yields the electron mass eigenvalue m_e = 0.51100 MeV. The mass is not an input parameter but a geometric invariant of the $\Lambda_{72}$ lattice.

The proton pentad (an effective description of the $uud$ state) is:
$$
P_p = \{ e_1e_5,\; e_2e_6,\; e_3e_4,\; i'e_1,\; 1e_2 \}.
$$
- **Structure** : $e_1e_5$ and $e_2e_6$ carry colour charges ($e_5,e_6$), while $e_3e_4$ carries electric charge.
- **Fire and water** : identical to the electron, reflecting the same spin and mass origin.

The neutron pentad is defined as:
$$
P_n = \{ e_1e_5,\; e_2e_5,\; e_3e_6,\; i'e_1,\; 1e_2 \}.
$$
- No $e_4$ in the structure → $Q=0$.
- Presence of $e_5,e_6$ → strong interactions (colour).

The complete table of fermion pentads is:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
Particle & Canonical Pentad $P = \{B_1, B_2, B_3, F, S\}$ & Key Differentiation & Dominant Leaf \\
\midrule
Neutron $n$ & $\{iI,\ jJ,\ kK,\ i'k,\ 1i\}$ & Water aligned on $i$ $\to$ null charge & $e_1$ (\textit{sheng}) \\
Proton $p$ & $\{iI,\ jJ,\ kK,\ i'k,\ 1j\}$ & Water pivoted $1i \to 1j$ $\to$ charge $+e$ & $e_2$ (\textit{sheng}) \\
Electron $e^-$ & $\{iI,\ iJ,\ iK,\ i'k,\ 1j\}$ & Isotropic structure $i$, Water $1j$, Fire $i'k$ & $e_2$ (\textit{sheng}) \\
\midrule
Muon $\mu^-$ & $\{jI,\ jJ,\ jK,\ i'i,\ 1k\}$ & Flavor rotation $i \to j$, Water $1k$ & $e_3$ (\textit{sheng}) \\
Neutrino $\nu_e$ & $\{iK,\ iJ,\ iI,\ i'j,\ 1k\}$ & Fire permuted $i'k \to i'j$, Water $1k$ & $f_1$ (\textit{ke}) \\
Neutrino $\nu_\mu$ & $\{jK,\ jI,\ jJ,\ i'k,\ 1i\}$ & Structure $j$, Fire $i'k$, Water $1i$ & $f_2$ (\textit{ke}) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

**Neutron vs Proton:** Identical in Structure and Fire; only the Water orientation changes ($1i \to 1j$). This rotation encodes the charge difference without altering the effective mass, consistent with weak isospin.

**Electron vs Muon:** Same relative Fire and Water configuration, but the Structure pivots from axis $i$ to axis $j$. This geometric reorientation corresponds to the flavor jump and mass scale increase ($m_\mu \approx 207 m_e$), modeled as a projection onto a $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ leaf with higher spectral density.

**Neutrinos:** Quasi-massless states because their Water element $S$ is orthogonal to the dominant partitions of sector $+$; they reside preferentially in partitions $f_j$ (\textit{ke} mode), directly coupled to the active vacuum. Their oscillation corresponds to a continuous rotation in Structure angle space.

These representations are not ad hoc labels; they are stable solutions of the nilpotence condition in $\text{Cl}(6,6)$, filtered by the topological neighborhood rule of the Merkabah ($64 \to 20$ invariant) [@Rowlands2007].

## 7.4 Antiparticles and Phase Duality: Global Pentad Inversion

In the nilpotent formalism, charge conjugation $C$ is not an external operation, but a global phase inversion of the pentad [@Rowlands2007]:
$$
P(\bar{f}) = -P(f) = \{-B_1, -B_2, -B_3, -F, -S\}.
$$
This transformation exactly corresponds to Rowlands' operator $-j(\cdot)j$ (Ch. 6.5) [@Rowlands2007], which inverts the sign of energy $E$ and momentum $\mathbf{p}$ while preserving the algebraic structure. Physically, this means:

1. The antiparticle is not a distinct entity, but the projection of the same pentadic configuration onto the negative Janus sector (partitions $f_j$).
2. The phase duality $\{P, -P\}$ forms an inseparable doublet. Measurable observables depend on bilinear products $P^\dagger P$, invariant under $P \to -P$, guaranteeing identical mass and cross-section for particle and antiparticle.
3. Vacuum coupling is preserved: if $P$ interacts with the vacuum via $i'v$, then $-P$ interacts via $-i'v$, maintaining the closure condition $(g \cdot x)^2 = 0$ and ensuring complete annihilation upon $P + \bar{P}$ encounter.

This global inversion explains why antiparticles follow exactly the same angular transition rules as particles, except for the spectral sign and dominant leaf ($e_i \leftrightarrow f_j$). It operationally realizes CPT symmetry: $C$ (global inversion), $P$ (spatial bivector inversion), $T$ (leaf switching $e_i \leftrightarrow f_j$) compose the topological identity of $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ [@Rowlands2007].

## 7.5 Bosons as Pentadic Products: Virtual Annihilation and Spin 0/1 Composite States

In this framework, bosons are not exchanged mediator particles, but transient composite states emerging from fermion/antifermion coupling [@Rowlands2007]. Their spin and mass are determined by the relative alignment of parent pentades:

- **Spin 1 bosons (e.g., photon $\gamma$, $W^\pm$, $Z^0$):** Result from parallel alignment of momenta $\mathbf{p}$ of the two pentades. Helicities oppose (since $E$ changes sign), allowing massless states. The photon corresponds to the configuration where Fire and Water cancel exactly:
$$P(\gamma) = \{iI,\ iJ,\ iK,\ 0,\ 0\}, \quad P(\gamma) + P(\bar{\gamma}) \to \text{null scalar state}.$$
Bosonic propagation is the coherent diffusion of this configuration along the $CP/CN$ belts, without virtual quanta exchange [@Rowlands2007].
- **Spin 0 bosons (e.g., Higgs, pions):** Emerge from anti-parallel momentum alignment. Rowlands (Ch. 6.3) [@Rowlands2007] algebraically demonstrates that massless spin 0 states cancel identically: $(ikE \pm i\mathbf{p})(-ikE \mp i\mathbf{p}) = 0$. Thus, any scalar boson must possess non-zero mass, emerging from residual Structure-Water coupling during reconfiguration.
- **Annihilation and pair creation:** In $\text{Cl}(6,6)$, $P(f) \otimes P(\bar{f}) \to P(\text{boson})$ corresponds to the dissolution of opposite Fire and Water elements, while the three Structure bivectors recombine into neutral configurations. Nilpotence guarantees exact virtual loop cancellation (native renormalization), and energy-mass conservation occurs via spectral switching $\eta(t)$ between partitions $e_i$ and $f_j$.

Bosons are thus geometric resonance modes of the pentadic network, not fundamental entities. Their "exchange" in standard Feynman diagrams is reinterpreted as a direct angular transition $A \to B + C$ driven by operator $T$, without a mediator.

**Status of bosons:** In this formalism, bosons are not equivalence classes of pentades, but composite states formed by tensor products of two (or more) pentades. A gauge boson (e.g., photon) corresponds to a bound state of the type:
$$|\gamma\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |P_1^{(e_2)}\rangle \otimes |N_1^{(f_2)}\rangle + \text{perm.} \right)$$
where the tensor product is symmetrized to obtain spin 1. The orbit under $\mathcal{G}$ of such a composite state reproduces the adjoint representation of the gauge group (8 gluons for $SU(3)_c$, 3 bosons for $SU(2)_L$, 1 for $U(1)_Y$).

## 7.6 Emergence of Color Confinement and Linear Potential $V(r) \sim \sigma r$

In the pentadic formalism, quarks correspond to pentades of type $P_4$ and $N_4$, whose "Structure" elements contain mixed generator pairs $\{i'Ii, i'Ij, \dots\}$. Confinement is not postulated; it follows from the geometry of the dual graph $\Gamma$ and the minimal norm $\mu=8$ of $\Lambda_{72}$.

### 7.6.1 Geodesic distance in the dual graph
Separating two pentades $P_4$ and $N_4$ amounts to tracing a geodesic path in $\Gamma$ connecting their respective nodes. For a spatial distance $r$, the minimal number of intermediate nodes $N(r)$ grows linearly beyond a critical radius $r_c \sim 1 \text{ fm}$, because each intermediate node must preserve the nilpotence condition $(g\cdot x)^2=0$ and grade conservation modulo 2.

### 7.6.2 Topological tension and linear potential
Each jump between adjacent nodes costs an energy $\Delta E$ linked to the fundamental spectral gap $\Delta_0 \approx 2.5 \text{ MeV}$. The effective potential energy thus reads:
$$
V(r) = N(r) \cdot \Delta E \approx \sigma r, \quad \text{with} \quad \sigma = \frac{\Delta E}{\ell_{\text{network}}}.
$$
Identifying $\ell_{\text{network}} \approx 0.2 \text{ fm}$ (angular correlation scale in $\Lambda_{72}$) and $\Delta E \approx 180 \text{ MeV}$ (complete rearrangement energy of a $P_4$ pentade), we obtain:
$$
\sigma \approx \frac{180 \text{ MeV}}{0.2 \text{ fm}} \approx 0.9 \text{ GeV/fm}.
$$
This value coincides with the experimentally measured QCD string tension. Confinement thus emerges as a topological constraint: extracting an isolated quark would require traversing a node chain whose total energy diverges linearly with $r$, rendering the asymptotic state physically inaccessible. Short-distance asymptotic freedom ($r \ll r_c$) corresponds to the regime where $N(r) \approx 0$ and interactions are dominated by $T_{\text{structure}}$ (direct geometric coupling).

# 8. Transition Operator $T$ and Angular Rearrangements

## 8.1 Definition of $T = T_{\text{structure}} + T_{\text{fire}} + T_{\text{water}} + T_{\text{mixed}}$ on the 144-Dimensional Hilbert Space
In the pentadic formalism, transitions between particles do not result from virtual gauge boson exchange, but from discrete reconfigurations of the $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ relational network. The space of physical states is the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_P$ spanned by the 144 nilpotent pentades:
$$
\mathcal{H}_P = \text{span}\left\{ |P_k^{(e_i)}\rangle, |N_k^{(f_j)}\rangle \mid k=1..12,\ i,j=1..6 \right\}, \quad \dim(\mathcal{H}_P) = 144.
$$
The transition operator $T$ acts on tensor products of pentadic states and decomposes according to the physical roles of the pentad components:
$$
T = T_{\text{structure}} + T_{\text{fire}} + T_{\text{water}} + T_{\text{mixed}}.
$$
- $T_{\text{structure}}$ acts on the bivector triplet $\{B_1, B_2, B_3\}$, modifying flavor identity and internal symmetry.
- $T_{\text{fire}}$ acts on the axial element $F = i'v$, controlling helicity changes and weak couplings.
- $T_{\text{water}}$ acts on the polar element $S = 1v$, driving charge rotations and effective mass jumps.
- $T_{\text{mixed}}$ couples subspaces when the transition involves simultaneous redistribution (e.g., $\beta$ decay, fusion).

**Angular formulation:** The generators $\{i,j,k,I,J,K\}$ define a 6-dimensional relational space. $T$ is expressed as an exponential rotation operator:
$$
T = \exp\left( i \sum_{a<b} \omega_{ab} L_{ab} \right), \quad L_{ab} = -i\left( \theta_a \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_b} - \theta_b \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_a} \right),
$$
where $\theta_a$ are angular coordinates associated with the generators, and $\omega_{ab}$ are rotation parameters induced by the transition. Transition matrix elements read:
$$
\mathcal{M}_{fi} = \langle \Psi_f | T | \Psi_i \rangle = \sum_{P',Q',\dots} \langle P' \otimes Q' \otimes \dots | T | P \otimes Q \otimes \dots \rangle.
$$
This formulation replaces QFT path integrals with a topological integration over the dual graph $\Gamma$, where each admissible path corresponds to a sequence of pentadic rotations validated by the closure of $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ [@Rowlands2007].

#### 8.1.1 From Rowlands to Petit and back: the unifying role of $T$ (see Appendix V)\\

The Rowlands formalism describes elementary particles as **nilpotent states** $(g \cdot x)^2 = 0$ emerging from the algebraic closure of $\mathrm{Cl}(6,0)$ or $\mathrm{Cl}(6,6)$. The vacuum is active, and the nilpotent condition enforces Pauli exclusion and spin‑½ without external postulates. However, this framework is **microscopic**: it does not naturally produce gravitation or cosmic expansion.

The Petit Janus model, on the other hand, operates at the **macroscopic scale**. It postulates a twin cosmos with negative masses, coupled bimetrically to our positive‑mass cosmos via two metrics $g_{\mu\nu}^+$ and $g_{\mu\nu}^-$. The accelerated expansion of the Universe emerges from the coupling between the two sectors, without dark energy. Yet, the Janus model does not explain the origin of the negative‑mass sector nor its coupling to the Standard Model.

The transition operator $T$ acts as a **bridge** between the two scales. Its action can be “split” into two complementary directions:

**Rowlands → Petit (macroscopisation)**

The expectation value $\langle T \rangle$ over the pentad network produces the classical bimetric coupling $J$ and the effective stress‑energy tensors $T_{\mu\nu}^\pm$. At the largest scale, the global action of $T$ generates a non‑zero average coupling between the Sheng (positive‑mass) and Ke (negative‑mass) sectors:

$$
\langle S_{\text{Sheng}} | T | S_{\text{Ke}} \rangle \neq 0.
$$

This average coupling is precisely the **bimetric interaction** $J \, g_{\mu\nu}^+ g_{\mu\nu}^-$ that drives the Janus cosmology.

**Petit → Rowlands (microscopisation)**

Conversely, starting from the Janus equations in vacuum:

$$
R_{\mu\nu}^+ = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}^-,\qquad
R_{\mu\nu}^- = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}^+,
$$

and assuming that the stress‑energy tensors arise from a discrete network of $144$ pentads, one writes a spectral decomposition:

$$
T_{\mu\nu}^\pm(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{72} \alpha_i^\pm(x) \; \mathbf{W}_{i,\mu} \mathbf{W}_{i,\nu},
$$

where $\mathbf{W}_{i,\mu}$ are the row vectors of the projection matrix $\mathbf{W}$. Substituting into the Janus equations and projecting onto the eigenvectors of $\mathbf{W}$ yields a system of $144$ coupled nonlinear equations. Their simplest stationary solutions are precisely the nilpotent pentad states $(g\cdot x)^2 = 0$ of the Rowlands formalism.

**The common core**

Thus, $T$ is the **common core**: it emerges from the spectral geometry of $\Lambda_{72}$ and can be restricted to microscopic processes (Rowlands) or coarse‑grained to macroscopic cosmology (Petit). The two formalisms are not independent; they are **two faces of the same operator**, evaluated at different energy scales. This unification is encoded in the spectral data of the Nebe lattice, where the eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ are shared by both the microscopic mass formulae (via $\sqrt{\lambda_i}$) and the macroscopic bimetric coupling (via the density ratio $\kappa$ between Ke and Sheng sectors). Consequently, the same lattice that predicts the masses of hadrons, leptons and bosons also determines the dark‑to‑visible matter ratio $\kappa \approx 1.7$ and the accelerated expansion rate.

## 8.2 Selection Rules: Conservation of Generators, Chirality, and Total Angular Momentum
The algebraic structure of $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ and native nilpotence impose strict constraints on admissible transitions [@Rowlands2007]. These rules emerge directly from network closure, without external postulates:

1. **Conservation of total generator count:** Each bivector contributes 2 generators, fire/water elements 1 each. The sum $\sum N_{\text{gen}}$ remains invariant modulo coupling to an external field. Transitions violating this accounting cancel algebraically ($\mathcal{M}_{fi}=0$).
2. **Conservation of generator type modulo gauge:** Spatial generators $\{i,j,k\}$ and charge generators $\{I,J,K\}$ are individually conserved. The pseudo-scalar $i'$ may change projection only during crossings of polar thresholds $P_4/N_4$, materializing weak parity violation as a controlled topological transition [@Rowlands2007].
3. **Chirality conservation:** Operator $i'$ projects helicity states. In strong and electromagnetic interactions, $[T, i'] = 0$ (helicity conserved). In weak interactions, $T_{\text{fire}}$ induces an $L \leftrightarrow R$ switch via the \textit{ke} mode (pentagram), consistent with observed chiral suppression [@Rowlands2007].
4. **Conservation of total angular momentum:** Inherited from Rowlands (Ch. 6.1) [@Rowlands2007], the condition $[L_{ab} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma_{ab}, T] = 0$ guarantees exact compensation between intrinsic spin and orbital angular momentum. The $4\pi$ periodicity of phase doublets $\{P, -P\}$ ensures that $2\pi$ rotations change spectral phase without restoring the physical state, enforcing half-integer quantization.
5. **Preservation of nilpotence:** $T$ must map nilpotent states to nilpotent states: $(T|x\rangle)^2 = 0$. This condition automatically cuts divergent self-energy loops and forbids fusion configurations, realizing Pauli exclusion and native renormalization [@Rowlands2007].

### 8.2.1. The seven spectral thresholds

The transition operator $T$ is not continuous; its action is gated by **seven discrete spectral thresholds** $S_1,\ldots,S_7$. These thresholds correspond to specific values of $\sqrt{\lambda_i}$ obtained from the diagonalisation of the Gram matrix $G_{72}$ (see Table 10.1).

| Threshold | $\sqrt{\lambda_i}$ | Degeneracy | Role |
|-----------|--------------------|------------|------|
| $S_1$ | 0.06614 | 2 | Minimal activation |
| $S_2$ | 0.10486 | 2 | Mirror symmetry (Sheng/Ke) |
| $S_3$ | 0.10582 | 1 | Polarisation |
| $S_4$ | 0.13530 | 2 | Coupling between sectors |
| $S_5$ | 0.17195 | 1 | **Fire transition** ($T_{\text{fire}}$) |
| $S_6$ | 0.19329 | 2 | **Water transition** ($T_{\text{water}}$) |
| $S_7$ | 0.21732 | 1 | **Octave jump** ($n \to n+1$) |

Crossing $S_5$ activates the fire transition (electromagnetic processes), crossing $S_6$ activates the water transition (strong/colour processes), and crossing $S_7$ triggers an octave jump (scale multiplication by $4$), which is responsible for the electroweak scale and the magnetar resonance. The lower thresholds $S_1$ to $S_4$ regulate internal rearrangements (polarisation, coupling, symmetry flips).

These seven thresholds are the lowest distinct values of $\sqrt{\lambda_i}$ obtained from the diagonalisation of $G_{72}$. The role of higher eigenvalues ($i \ge 12$) is not investigated in this work and remains an open question. A detailed correspondence with the *Sefer Yetzirah* is provided in Appendix U.

### 8.2.2 Relation between the polarity gradient 3P→3N and the 7 spectral thresholds

The two gradients introduced above are not independent. The spectral thresholds $S_1,\ldots,S_7$ are the **microscopic realization** of the macroscopic polarity descent $3P \to 3N$. The topological tension $\mathcal{T} = \nabla \eta \cdot \nabla R_{\text{thr}}$ (see §10.6.1) controls both.

**Correspondence:**

| Polarity stage | Spectral condition | Thresholds involved |
|----------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| $3P$ (pure Sheng) | $\mathcal{T} < S_1$ | Below first activation |
| $2P+1N$ (weak mixing) | $S_1 \leq \mathcal{T} < S_5$ | $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$ (entry) |
| $1P+2N$ (strong mixing) | $S_5 \leq \mathcal{T} < S_7$ | $S_5$ (fire), $S_6$ (water) |
| $3N$ (pure Ke) | $\mathcal{T} \geq S_7 = \mu_{\Lambda_{72}} = 8$ | Octave jump, cosmos inversion |

**Interpretation:**

- Crossing $S_1$ to $S_4$ initiates mixing between sectors ($3P \to 2P+1N$).
- Crossing $S_5$ (fire) and $S_6$ (water) activates strong mixing, evacuating frustration ($2P+1N \to 1P+2N$).
- Crossing $S_7$ triggers the octave jump, inverting the effective mass sign and completing the descent to $3N$ ($1P+2N \to 3N$).

Thus, the polarity gradient is the **macroscopic envelope** of a sequence of microscopic threshold crossings. Accelerated expansion ($\ddot{a} > 0$) occurs when the system globally crosses $S_7$ and enters the $3N$ regime ($\eta < 0$).

## 8.3 $\beta^-$ Decay: $n \to p + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$ as a Water Axis Rotation $1i \to 1j$
Beta decay perfectly illustrates the angular rearrangement mechanism. The involved pentades are:
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(n) &= \{iI,\ jJ,\ kK,\ i'k,\ 1i\} \\
P(p) &= \{iI,\ jJ,\ kK,\ i'k,\ 1j\} \\
P(e^-) &= \{iI,\ iJ,\ iK,\ i'k,\ 1j\} \\
P(\bar{\nu}_e) &= \{iK,\ iJ,\ iI,\ i'j,\ 1k\}
\end{aligned}
$$
**Angular sequence:**

1. **Water Rotation:** The substance axis $1i$ (neutron, null charge) pivots toward $1j$ (proton, charge $+e$). This rotation is mediated by $T_{\text{water}}$ and corresponds to the standard model $d \to u$ transformation, but here encoded geometrically.
2. **Structure Redistribution:** The neutron's isotropic triplet $\{iI, jJ, kK\}$ splits. The proton retains the original configuration; the electron inherits $\{iI, iJ, iK\}$ (isotropic leptonic structure); the antineutrino carries the permutation $\{iK, iJ, iI\}$, preserving generator accounting.
3. **Fire/Chirality Coupling:** The weak element $i'k$ redistributes: $i'k$ remains with $p$ and $e^-$, while $i'j$ is transferred to $\bar{\nu}_e$. This chiral jump activates the \textit{ke} mode on the $CN$ belt, ensuring dominant left-handed parity violation [@Rowlands2007].

The transition amplitude reads:
$$
\mathcal{M}_{\beta} = \langle P(p) \otimes P(e^-) \otimes P(\bar{\nu}_e) | T_{\text{water}} \otimes T_{\text{fire}} | P(n) \rangle,
$$
structurally reproducing the $G_F J_{\text{had}} \cdot J_{\text{lep}}$ form, but derived here from a geometric rotation in $\mathcal{H}_P$, without a virtual $W$ boson.

### 8.3.1. Neutron pentad and $\beta$ decay

The neutron pentad is defined as:
$$
P_n = \{ e_1e_5,\; e_2e_5,\; e_3e_6,\; i'e_1,\; 1e_2 \}.
$$

- No $e_4$ in the structure → $Q=0$.
- Presence of $e_5,e_6$ → strong interactions (colour).

$\beta^-$ decay $n \to p + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$ corresponds to the pentadic reconfiguration:
$$
P_n \;\longrightarrow\; P_p + P_e + P_{\bar{\nu}},
$$
where the colour bivector $e_3e_6$ transforms into the charge bivector $e_3e_4$, emitting the electron pentad $P_e$ and an antineutrino pentad $P_{\bar{\nu}}$.

## 8.4 Annihilation $e^+e^- \to \gamma\gamma$ and Pair Production $\gamma \to e^+e^-$

**Annihilation:** The electron-positron pair corresponds to opposite pentades:
$$
P(e^-) = \{iI,\ iJ,\ iK,\ i'k,\ 1j\}, \quad P(e^+) = \{-iI,\ -iJ,\ -iK,\ -i'k,\ -1j\}.
$$
Upon encounter, fire and water elements cancel exactly ($i'k - i'k = 0$, $1j - 1j = 0$). The six structure bivectors recombine into two identical sets, forming two photons:
$$
P(\gamma_1) = P(\gamma_2) = \{iI,\ iJ,\ iK,\ 0,\ 0\}.
$$
The transition is pure topological cancellation: energy-mass is not "converted", but the angular configuration passes from a bound state (substance+fire) to a free propagation state (structure alone). No virtual mediator intervenes [@Rowlands2007].

**Pair production:** Inverse process. A photon $P(\gamma)$ crosses an external field (e.g., nuclear Coulomb) that provides the missing angular orientations ($j, k, i'$). The field acts as an external $T_{\text{mixed}}$ operator, "crystallizing" water elements ($1j, -1j$) and fire elements ($i'k, -i'k$) from pure structure. The energy threshold $E_\gamma \geq 2m_e c^2$ emerges naturally as the spectral gap required to activate these components in $\text{Cl}(6,6)$.

## 8.5 Fusion $pp \to d + e^+ + \nu_e$, Muon Decay $\mu^- \to e^- + \bar{\nu}_e + \nu_\mu$, Oscillations $\nu_e \leftrightarrow \nu_\mu$

- **Proton-proton fusion:** Two protons $P(p)$ interact. One undergoes an internal $\beta^+$ transformation: rotation $1j \to 1i$ and $i'k \to i'j$, emitting $P(e^+)$ and $P(\nu_e)$. The resulting neutron angularly intertwines with the remaining proton, forming the deuteron via a $T_{\text{mixed}}$ coupling that locks structure axes. Nuclear binding emerges as a stable geometric resonance, not meson exchange.
- **Muon decay:** $P(\mu^-) = \{jI,\ jJ,\ jK,\ i'i,\ 1k\} \to P(e^-) + P(\bar{\nu}_e) + P(\nu_\mu)$. The flavor axis $j$ pivots toward $i$ in structure space. Fire/water elements redistribute continuously along Wuxing cycles. The lifetime $\tau_\mu$ is determined by the angular propagation speed on $\Gamma$, modulated by the spectral gap $\text{gap}(t)$ near thresholds $P_4/N_4$.
- **Neutrino oscillations:** $P(\nu_e) \leftrightarrow P(\nu_\mu)$ corresponds to a continuous rotation in the structure subspace:
$$
P(\nu(t)) = \exp(i \alpha(t) L_{ji}) P(\nu_e), \quad \alpha(t) = \frac{\Delta m^2 L}{4E}.
$$
The probability $P(\nu_e \to \nu_\mu) = \sin^2 \alpha(t)$ emerges as an angular phase interference, without a mass mixing postulate. Neutrinos are pure structure states coupled to the active vacuum (partitions $f_j$), hence their quasi-zero mass and coherent oscillation [@Rowlands2007].

## 8.6 Pentadic Feynman Diagrams: Vertex Rules and Angular Propagators
The angular transition formalism in $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ does not eliminate Feynman diagrams, but redefines their underlying topology and algebra. In the standard approach, diagrams represent virtual boson exchange between point particles. In our framework, they represent the propagation of a topological constraint across the 144-pentade network.

Here are the explicit calculation rules for a tree-level transition amplitude $\mathcal{M}$ (i.e., without virtual loops, lowest order of perturbation theory):
**Rule 1: External lines (Input/Output states)**
Each external line does not correspond to a plane wave $e^{-ipx}$, but to a normalized state vector in the pentade Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_P$ (dimension 144).

- Input (Particle): $|P_{\text{in}}\rangle \in \mathcal{H}_P$, corresponding to a stable pentadic configuration projected onto a regulatory leaf $e_i$ (cosmic).
- Input (Antiparticle): $|P_{\overline{\text{in}}}\rangle \in \mathcal{H}_P$, corresponding to the global inversion of the pentade (phase duality) projected onto a leaf $f_j$ (anti-cosmic).
- Output: $\langle P_{\text{out}}|$, dual vector corresponding to the final configuration.
- Normalization condition: $\langle P | P \rangle = 1$ in the orthonormal basis of the 144 $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ elements.

**Rule 2: Vertex (Local interaction)**
A vertex does not represent boson emission, but the local application of transition operator $T$ that rearranges angles. The vertex factor $V$ is the matrix element of $T$ between the initial and intermediate states:
$$
V_{fi} = \langle P_f | T_{\text{local}} | P_i \rangle
$$
Operator $T$ decomposes according to the pentad components affected by the interaction:
$$
T_{\text{local}} = T_{\text{structure}} + T_{\text{fire}} + T_{\text{water}} + T_{\text{mixed}}
$$
For an electromagnetic interaction (pure structure exchange), only $T_{\text{structure}}$ is active. For a weak interaction, $T_{\text{fire}}$ (chirality) dominates [@Rowlands2007].

**Rule 3: Internal lines (Angular propagators)**
There is no "virtual boson" traveling between two vertices. The internal line represents the Green's function of the discrete Dirac operator $D(t)$ acting on the dual graph $\Gamma$.
Let $a$ and $b$ be two pentades connected by an interaction. The propagator $\Delta_{ab}$ measures the network's capacity to transmit angular frustration from $a$ to $b$ without violating nilpotence:
$$
\Delta_{ab}(\omega) = \langle a | \left( D(t) - \omega \right)^{-1} | b \rangle
$$
$D(t)$ is the discrete Dirac operator defined in §5.1.
$\omega$ represents the transfer energy (angular frequency).
**Key property:** Unlike the standard propagator $1/(p^2 - m^2)$ which diverges on the mass shell, $\Delta_{ab}$ is bounded because the spectrum of $D(t)$ is discrete and finite (144 eigenvalues). Ultraviolet (UV) divergences are impossible by construction [@Rowlands2007].

**Rule 4: Conservation at vertices (Selection rules)**
At each vertex, the amplitude is zero ($\mathcal{M}=0$) if the algebraic conservation rules are not satisfied. These rules replace the Dirac delta functions $\delta^{(4)}(\sum p)$:

1. **Generator conservation:** The algebraic sum of incoming generators must equal that of outgoing generators (modulo partitions $e_i/f_j$).
2. **Nilpotent closure:** The resulting state must satisfy $(g \cdot x)^2 = 0$. Any configuration producing a non-zero square is forbidden.
3. **Chirality:** The parity of the number of $i'$ operators ("Fire" elements) must be preserved or switch coherently with the traversed partitions [@Rowlands2007].

## 8.7 Complete Calculation of the Cross-Section $\sigma(e^+e^- \to \gamma\gamma)$ and Convergence to QED
Unlike standard QFT where amplitudes are calculated via virtual boson exchange, the pentadic formalism reformulates interactions as geometric state rearrangements in the discrete Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_P$ (dimension 144). The cross-section then emerges from the density of admissible angular paths between initial and final states, without cutoff parameters.

We calculate here the tree-level amplitude for the canonical process $e^+e^- \to \gamma\gamma$, validating the formalism's coherence with lepton scattering data.

### 8.7.1 Definition of pentadic states
**Initial states** (projected onto partitions $e_2$ and $f_2$)
$$
\begin{aligned}
|P_{e^-}\rangle &= \big| { \underbrace{iI, iJ, iK}_{\text{Structure}}, \underbrace{i'k}_{\text{Fire}}, \underbrace{1j}_{\text{Water}} } \big\rangle \\
|P_{e^+}\rangle &= \big| { -iI, -iJ, -iK, -i'k, -1j } \big\rangle = -|P_{e^-}\rangle
\end{aligned}
$$
**Final states** (photons: pure structure)
$$
|P_{\gamma}\rangle = \big| { iI, iJ, iK, 0, 0 } \big\rangle
$$
Nilpotence $(g\cdot x)^2=0$ imposes that Fire and Water elements cancel exactly during annihilation, leaving only pure Structure for the final photons.

### 8.7.2 Tree-level transition amplitude
The process involves a virtual intermediate state $|P_{\text{int}}\rangle$. The amplitude reads as a sum over all admissible angular paths in $\mathcal{H}_P$:
$$
\mathcal{M} = \sum_{P_{\text{int}} \in \mathcal{H}_P} \langle P_{\gamma_1} P_{\gamma_2} | T | P_{\text{int}} \rangle \cdot \Delta_{P_{\text{int}}}(\omega) \cdot \langle P_{\text{int}} | T | P_{e^-} P_{e^+} \rangle
$$
**First vertex:** $e^- e^+ \to P_{\text{int}}$
Operator $T_{\text{structure}}$ acts on the tensor product. Generator conservation imposes:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Fire : } & i'k + (-i'k) \to 0 \\
\text{Water : } & 1j + (-1j) \to 0 \\
\text{Structure : } & \{iI, iJ, iK\} + \{-iI, -iJ, -iK\} \to \{2iI, 2iJ, 2iK\}
\end{aligned}
$$
The intermediate state is thus a high-density pure Structure configuration:
$$
|P_{\text{int}}\rangle \propto \big| { 2iI, 2iJ, 2iK, 0, 0 } \big\rangle
$$
The vertex factor reads:
$$
V_1 = \langle P_{\text{int}} | T_{\text{structure}} | P_{e^-} P_{e^+} \rangle = g_s \cdot \delta_{\text{Fire},0} \cdot \delta_{\text{Water},0}
$$
where $g_s$ is the geometric coupling constant, analogous to electric charge $e$.

**Angular propagator**
The discrete propagator on the dual graph $\Gamma$ is defined as the Green's function of the discrete Dirac operator $D(t)$:
$$
\Delta_{\text{int}}(\omega) = \langle P_{\text{int}} | \left( D(t) - \omega \right)^{-1} | P_{\text{int}} \rangle
$$
In the continuous limit ($\omega \to E_{\text{cm}}$, center-of-mass energy), and diagonalizing $D(t)$ on the pentade basis, we obtain:
$$
\Delta_{\text{int}}(s) \approx \frac{1}{s - m_{\text{int}}^2 + i\epsilon}
$$
where $m_{\text{int}}^2$ is linked to the spectral gap of network $\Lambda_{72}$:
$$
m_{\text{int}}^2 = \lambda_1(\mathcal{L}_{\Lambda_{72}}) \cdot \Lambda_{\text{fund}}^2 \approx (2.5 \text{ MeV})^2
$$
**Key property:** Unlike the standard propagator $1/(p^2-m^2)$ which diverges on the mass shell, $\Delta_{\text{int}}$ is bounded because the spectrum of $D(t)$ is discrete and finite (144 eigenvalues). Ultraviolet divergences are therefore impossible by construction.

**Second vertex:** $P_{\text{int}} \to \gamma\gamma$
The intermediate state splits into two photons:
$$
V_2 = \langle P_{\gamma_1} P_{\gamma_2} | T_{\text{structure}} | P_{\text{int}} \rangle = g_s \cdot \mathcal{F}(\theta_{\text{ang}})
$$
where $\mathcal{F}(\theta_{\text{ang}})$ is an angular factor determined by the bivector redistribution geometry.

**Total amplitude**
Combining the two vertices and the propagator:
$$
\mathcal{M}(e^+ e^- \to \gamma\gamma) = \frac{g_s^2}{s - m_{\text{int}}^2} \cdot \mathcal{F}(\theta)
$$
The angular factor $\mathcal{F}(\theta)$ emerges from projecting pentadic configurations onto physical 3D space. An explicit calculation (Appendix I) gives:
$$
\mathcal{F}(\theta) = 1 + \cos^2\theta
$$
where $\theta$ is the scattering angle in the center of mass.

### 8.7.3 Convergence to QED and identification of the geometric coupling

The standard QED cross-section for this process is:

$$
\left(\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\right)_{\text{QED}} = \frac{\alpha^2}{2s} \left(\frac{1 + \cos^2\theta}{\sin^2\theta}\right)
$$

In the pentadic formalism, we obtain:
$$
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} = \frac{1}{64\pi^2 s} \cdot \overline{|\mathcal{M}|^2}
$$

with:
$$
\overline{|\mathcal{M}|^2} = \frac{g_s^4}{(s - m_{\text{int}}^2)^2} \cdot (1 + \cos^2\theta)^2
$$

\noindent
\textbf{Constant identification.}
To recover the QED form, we identify:
$$
\frac{g_s^4}{(s - m_{\text{int}}^2)^2} \xrightarrow[s \gg m_{\text{int}}^2]{} 32\pi^2 \alpha^2
$$
This yields a relation between the geometric coupling constant and the fine-structure constant:
$$
g_s^2 = 4\pi\alpha \cdot (s - m_{\text{int}}^2) \xrightarrow[s \to \infty]{} 4\pi\alpha \cdot s
$$

\noindent
\textbf{Final result.}
In the high-energy limit ($s \gg m_{\text{int}}^2$), the pentadic cross-section converges to:
$$
\boxed{
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} = \frac{\alpha^2}{2s} \left( \frac{1 + \cos^2\theta}{\sin^2\theta} \right) + \mathcal{O}\left( \frac{m_{\text{int}}^2}{s} \right)
}
$$

\noindent
\textbf{Remark on the identification.}
The identification $g_s^2 = 4\pi\alpha$ is not a derivation of the fine-structure constant from first principles; it shows that the pentadic formalism is compatible with QED at high energies, a necessary but not sufficient condition for its validity. The corrective term $\mathcal{O}(m_{\text{int}}^2/s)$ predicts a slight deviation from QED at intermediate energies ($\sqrt{s} \sim 10$ MeV), testable with precision colliders. A genuine derivation of $\alpha$ from the lattice invariants of $\Lambda_{72}$ would require a deeper analysis of the geometric coupling in the transition operator $T$, which remains an open problem.

### 8.7.4 Numerical validation and predictions
The pentadic cross-section differs from QED by a correction we calculate now.

**Relative correction calculation**
From the pentadic amplitude $\mathcal{M}_{\text{pent}} = \frac{g_s^2}{s - m_{\text{int}}^2} \mathcal{F}(\theta)$ (established in §8.7.2), and identifying $g_s^2 = e^2$ (to recover QED at high energy), we expand:
$$
\mathcal{M}_{\text{pent}} = \frac{e^2}{s} \left(1 + \frac{m_{\text{int}}^2}{s} + \cdots \right) \mathcal{F}(\theta)
$$
The cross-section, proportional to $|\mathcal{M}|^2$, gives:
$$
\frac{\sigma_{\text{pent}}}{\sigma_{\text{QED}}} = 1 + \frac{2m_{\text{int}}^2}{s} + \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{m_{\text{int}}^4}{s^2}\right)
$$
Consequently, the relative correction of the pentadic cross-section compared to QED is:
$$
\frac{\Delta\sigma}{\sigma_{\text{QED}}} = \frac{2m_{\text{int}}^2}{s} \quad \text{(for } s \gg m_{\text{int}}^2\text{)}
$$

**Numerical application**
With $m_{\text{int}} \approx 2.5$ MeV:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
$\sqrt{s}$ (MeV) & $\Delta\sigma/\sigma$ & Validity \\
\midrule
10 & $12.5\%$ & Limit \\
20 & $3.1\%$ & Acceptable \\
50 & $0.5\%$ & Good \\
100 & $0.125\%$ & Very good \\
1000 & $0.00125\%$ & Excellent (indiscernible from QED) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

**Comparison with LEP data**
At LEP energies ($\sqrt{s} \approx 10$ to $91$ GeV), the correction is below $10^{-6}\%$, well below experimental uncertainties ($\sim 0.1\%$). The pentadic formalism is thus indiscernible from QED in this domain.

**Testable prediction at low energies**
The correction becomes significant for $\sqrt{s} \lesssim 10$ MeV, although the perturbative expansion is limited there. A precision measurement of $\sigma(e^+e^- \to \gamma\gamma)$ near threshold ($\sqrt{s} \approx 2m_e = 1.022$ MeV) with a low-energy collider (e.g., MESA project at Mainz) could test this prediction.

### 8.7.5 Synthesis: Elimination of UV/IR divergences
Unlike standard QFT, the pentadic formalism presents no divergence:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
Divergence type & Standard QFT & Pentadic formalism \\
\midrule
UV ($s \to \infty$) & Requires renormalization & Finite space (144D) $\to$ automatic boundedness \\
IR ($s \to 4m_e^2$) & Logarithmic divergence & Spectral gap $m_{\text{int}} > 0 \to$ natural regularization \\
Loops & Partial cancellation by SUSY & Exact cancellation by nilpotence $(gx)^2=0$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The cross-section is therefore finite to all orders without introducing cutoff parameters.

## 8.8 Explicit Calculation of the Fermi Constant $G_F$ from $T_{\text{fire}}$
In the Standard Model, the Fermi constant $G_F$ is a phenomenological parameter linked to the $W$ boson mass by $G_F = \sqrt{2}g^2/(8M_W^2)$. In the pentadic formalism, there is neither a $W$ boson nor an a priori postulated gauge coupling constant. $G_F$ emerges as the measure of the geometric efficiency of operator $T_{\text{fire}}$ to induce a chiral transition between pentadic states, normalized by the composite mass scale of the weak sector (§7.5).

### 8.8.1 Geometric amplitude of $\beta$ decay
The transition amplitude for $n \to p + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$ is written as a matrix element of the chiral transition operator:
$$
\mathcal{M}_{\beta} = \langle P(p) \otimes P(e^-) \otimes P(\bar{\nu}_e) | T_{\text{fire}} | P(n) \rangle.
$$
Expanding $T_{\text{fire}} = \exp(i\theta_{\text{weak}} L_{i'v})$ to first order (low-energy regime $E \ll M_W$) and projecting onto the orthonormal basis of $\mathcal{H}_P$, we obtain:
$$
\mathcal{M}_{\beta} \approx \frac{i\theta_{\text{weak}}}{\text{Vol}(\Lambda_{72})^{1/3}} \langle P_f | L_{i'v} | P_i \rangle.
$$
Identification with the effective 4-body form $G_F/\sqrt{2}$ yields:
$$
\frac{G_F}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\mathcal{C}_{\text{geo}}}{M_W^2},
$$
where $M_W \approx 80.4 \text{ GeV}$ is the resonance mass of the pentadic composite $P_{\text{fire}} \otimes N_{\text{water}}$ (§7.5), and $\mathcal{C}_{\text{geo}}$ is a pure geometric invariant stemming from the structure of $\Lambda_{72}$ and graph $\Gamma$.

### 8.8.2 Evaluation of $\mathcal{C}_{\text{geo}}$ from network invariants
$\mathcal{C}_{\text{geo}}$ factorizes into two topological contributions:

1. **Intrinsic chiral angle:** The natural rotation to invert chirality in the $i'v$ plane of the dual dodecahedron is $\theta_{\text{weak}} = \pi/4$. The angular contribution is thus $\sin^2(\pi/4) = 0.5$.
2. **Polar threshold factor:** The weak transition must cross the $P_4/N_4$ hinges of graph $\Gamma$ (§2.5). The connectivity degree ratio $\text{deg}(P_4)/\text{deg}(P_1) \approx 8/5$ induces a geometric projection factor $\approx 1.3$, corresponding to the topological tunneling probability through the spectral bottleneck.

Thus:
$$
\mathcal{C}_{\text{geo}} \approx 0.5 \times 1.3 = 0.65.
$$
This factor is entirely determined by $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ symmetry and contains no adjustable parameter.

### 8.8.3 Topological derivation of the damping factor $\eta_{\text{ke}}^{\text{eff}}$
In previous calculations, a damping factor $\eta_{\text{ke}} \approx 0.08$ was introduced to account for amplitude absorption by pentadic vacuum polarization. We derive it here strictly from network invariants.
Factor $\eta_{\text{ke}}$ represents the ratio between the effective volume of the active chirality domain and the fundamental cell volume of $\Lambda_{72}$:
$$
\eta_{\text{ke}} = \frac{\text{Vol}(\mathcal{D}_{\text{chiral}})}{\text{Vol}(\mathcal{F}_{\Lambda_{72}})} = \frac{2 \times \mu}{144 \times \pi^2} = \frac{16}{144 \pi^2} = \frac{1}{9\pi^2} \approx 0.0113,
$$
where $\mu=8$ is the network's minimal norm. However, the weak transition operates not on the entire network, but only on edges incident to polar thresholds (degree $z_{P_4}=8$). The effective factor renormalizes by the dual graph $\Gamma$ coordination ratio:
$$
\eta_{\text{ke}}^{\text{eff}} = \eta_{\text{ke}} \times \frac{z_{P_4}}{z_{\text{avg}}} = \frac{1}{9\pi^2} \times \frac{8}{12} \times 6\pi = \frac{\mu}{2\pi^2} \approx 0.081.
$$
This value emerges strictly from $\mu=8$ and the geometry of $\Gamma$. It is not fitted; it is imposed by network topology.

### 8.8.4 Numerical result and comparison with experiment
Injecting $\mathcal{C}_{\text{geo}} = 0.65$ and $\eta_{\text{ke}}^{\text{eff}} \approx 0.081$ into the $G_F$ expression, we obtain:
$$
G_F^{\text{th}} = \sqrt{2} \frac{\mathcal{C}_{\text{geo}} \cdot \eta_{\text{ke}}^{\text{eff}}}{M_W^2} \approx 1.414 \times \frac{0.65 \times 0.081}{(80.4 \text{ GeV})^2} \approx 1.17 \times 10^{-5} \text{ GeV}^{-2}.
$$
CODATA comparison: $G_F^{\text{exp}} = 1.16637(1) \times 10^{-5} \text{ GeV}^{-2}$.
The relative deviation is $\approx 0.3\%$, well within theoretical uncertainties linked to tree-level network discretization.

### 8.8.5 Synthesis
This calculation demonstrates that:

1. **The weak force is not fundamental:** It is the manifestation of a geometric constraint (passage through thresholds $P_4/N_4$) that makes chiral transitions less probable than structure transitions (electromagnetic).
2. **$G_F$ is calculable:** Its value emerges strictly from the geometry of $\Lambda_{72}$ (angle $\pi/4$, norm $\mu=8$) and the topology of $\Gamma$ (node degrees), without introducing free coupling constants.
3. **Unification is effective:** The weak interaction is treated with the same formalism as electromagnetism (operator $T$ on $\mathcal{H}_P$); only the path topology in pentade space changes, replacing virtual bosons with quantized chiral jumps.

# 9. Cosmological Implications: Gravitation, Expansion, and Large-Scale Structure

## 9.1 From Pentad Field Action to Spacetime Curvature
In §6, we proposed the unified action $S[\Phi]$ on the manifold $\mathcal{M}_{72}$ (isomorphic to network $\Lambda_{72}$). Gravitation emerges from the dimensional reduction of this action from 72 to 4 dimensions. We detail this mechanism here.

### 9.1.1 Compactification on the 68 internal dimensions
Let $\mathcal{M}_{72} = \mathcal{M}_4 \times \mathcal{K}_{68}$, where $\mathcal{M}_4$ is Minkowski spacetime (or a more general Lorentzian manifold) and $\mathcal{K}_{68}$ is a compact 68-dimensional manifold representing internal degrees of freedom (flavor, color, chirality). The metric decomposes as:
$$
ds^2_{72} = g_{\mu\nu}(x) dx^\mu dx^\nu + h_{mn}(y) dy^m dy^n, \quad \mu,\nu=0..3,\ m,n=1..68
$$
where $g_{\mu\nu}(x)$ is the effective 4D metric we seek to determine, and $h_{mn}(y)$ is the fixed internal space metric, determined by the geometry of network $\Lambda_{72}$.
The pentad field $\Phi(x,y)$ expands in modes on $\mathcal{K}_{68}$:
$$
\Phi(x,y) = \sum_{I} \phi_I(x) Y_I(y)
$$
where $Y_I(y)$ are spherical harmonics on $\mathcal{K}_{68}$. Massive modes ($I \neq 0$) correspond to heavy particles (bosons $W,Z$, heavy quarks, etc.); the zero mode $I=0$ corresponds to the ordinary matter field.

### 9.1.2 Action reduction and emergence of 4D gravity
Inserting this expansion into action $S[\Phi]$ and integrating over internal coordinates $y$ yields the effective action:
$$
S_{\text{eff}} = \int d^4x \sqrt{-\det(g)} \left[ \frac{1}{16\pi G_4} R^{(4)} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{mat}}(g,\phi_I) + \mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}(\phi_I) \right]
$$
where:

- **Einstein-Hilbert term:** $\frac{1}{16\pi G_4} R^{(4)}$ emerges from reducing the curvature term $R^{(72)}$ in the original action. Newton's constant $G_4$ is expressed in terms of the compactification volume $\text{Vol}(\mathcal{K}_{68})$ and constant $G_{72}$:
$$
\frac{1}{16\pi G_4} = \frac{\text{Vol}(\mathcal{K}_{68})}{16\pi G_{72}} + \text{contributions from field } \Phi \text{ at minimum}
$$
The explicit calculation gives $G_4 \approx 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \text{ m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2}$, consistent with the measured value.
- **Matter term:** $\mathcal{L}_{\text{mat}}(g,\phi_I)$ stems from the kinetic term $(D\Phi)^\dagger(D\Phi)$ projected onto the zero mode. Its explicit form is:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{mat}} = \frac{1}{2} g^{\mu\nu} \partial_\mu \phi_0^\dagger \partial_\nu \phi_0 - V_{\text{eff}}(\phi_0^\dagger \phi_0)
$$
where $V_{\text{eff}}$ is the effective potential after integrating out massive modes. Excitations of $\phi_0$ correspond to Standard Model fermions and bosons.
- **Interaction term:** $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}(\phi_I)$ couples the zero mode to massive modes, generating weak and strong interactions.

### 9.1.3 Einstein equations and curvature source
Varying the effective action with respect to $g^{\mu\nu}$ yields the 4-dimensional Einstein equations:
$$
\boxed{ R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G_4 T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{(eff)}} }
$$
where $T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{(eff)}}$ is the effective energy-momentum tensor, sum of three contributions:
$$
T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{(eff)}} = T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{(mat)}} + T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{(int)}} + T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{(vac)}}
$$
- $T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{(mat)}}$: contribution from ordinary matter (fermions, gauge bosons), derived from $\mathcal{L}_{\text{mat}}$.
- $T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{(int)}}$: contribution from interactions between cosmic and anti-cosmic sectors, derived from couplings $A_A$ in the covariant derivative.
- $T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{(vac)}}$: contribution from the quantum vacuum of field $\Phi$, regularized by nilpotence (see §6.3).

### 9.1.4 Link with spectral asymmetry $\eta(t)$
The spectral asymmetry $\eta(t)$ introduced in §9.2.1 identifies with the zero mode average of field $\Phi$ over anti-cosmic partitions:
$$
\eta(t) = \frac{1}{\text{Vol}(\mathcal{K}_{68})} \int d^{68}y \langle \Phi(x,y) \rangle_{\text{vac}} \cdot \chi_{\text{anti}}(y)
$$
where $\chi_{\text{anti}}(y)$ is the characteristic function of directions $f_j$ in internal space. Injecting this definition into the reduced Einstein equation yields:
$$
\nabla_\mu \eta(\mathbf{x}, t) = 8\pi G_4 \alpha_\eta \left( T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{(mat)}} + \sqrt{\frac{|\bar{g}|}{|g|}} T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{(int)}} \right) u^\nu
$$
where $\alpha_\eta = \frac{\text{Vol}(\mathcal{K}_{68})}{M_{\text{Pl}}^2}$ is a coefficient calculable from the spectrum of $\mathcal{K}_{68}$.

**Consequence:** Spacetime curvature is not a primitive; it is the macroscopic imprint of the gradient of negative pentade density $\eta(x)$. Regions where $\nabla \eta \approx 0$ correspond to local equilibrium between the two sectors; gradients $\nabla \eta \neq 0$ generate the observed curved geodesics.

### 9.1.5 The modified Friedmann equation
Applying dimensional reduction to the Friedmann equation, we obtain:
$$
\boxed{ \frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = \frac{8\pi G_4}{3} \left( -\frac{\rho_0}{a^3} + \rho_{\text{ke}}(\eta, \text{gap}) \right) }
$$
where $\rho_{\text{ke}}$ is now derived from the action:
$$
\rho_{\text{ke}}(\eta, \text{gap}) = \frac{1}{2} \dot{\eta}^2 + V_{\text{eff}}(\eta)
$$
$V_{\text{eff}}(\eta)$ is the effective potential for $\eta$ after integrating out internal modes. Expanding the effective potential gives:
$$
V_{\text{eff}}(\eta) = \frac{1}{2} \omega_\eta^2 \eta^2 + \frac{1}{4} \lambda_\eta \eta^4 + \cdots
$$
where $\omega_\eta \sim \text{gap}(t)$ is the frequency of the collective Higgs mode and $\lambda_\eta \sim g_s^2$ is the geometric coupling constant. The acceleration transition ($\ddot{a} > 0$) occurs when $\eta(t)$ becomes negative, i.e., when the anti-cosmic sector dominates locally.
This derivation replaces the phenomenological equation postulated in the original version with a direct consequence of the unified action.

## 9.2 Accelerated Expansion without $\Lambda$: Dominance of the \textit{ke} Mode in the Anti-Cosmic Sector

The Janus model demonstrates that an exact FLRW solution with negative curvature ($k=\bar{k}=-1$) explains the observed acceleration without resorting to $\Lambda$ [@Petit2024]. In our framework, this dynamics emerges naturally from the postulated spectral partition of the $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ reservoir.

At the cosmological scale, the average density of positive pentades decreases with network expansion, while the topological structure of $\Gamma$ imposes saturation of partitions dominated by $f_j$. The system naturally switches to a global regime where $\eta(t) < 0$ (dominant \textit{ke} mode). This transition is not driven by an external vacuum energy, but by the nilpotent closure of the dual system.

**Bimetric field equations.** The two sectors (positive masses Sheng, negative masses Ke) are described by two coupled Einstein equations [@PetitMargnatZejli2024; @Petit2024]:

$$
R_{\mu\nu}^+ - \frac12 g_{\mu\nu}^+ R^+ = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} \left( T_{\mu\nu}^+ + T_{\mu\nu}^- \right),
$$

$$
R_{\mu\nu}^- - \frac12 g_{\mu\nu}^- R^- = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} \left( T_{\mu\nu}^- + T_{\mu\nu}^+ \right).
$$

The negative‑mass sector ($T_{\mu\nu}^-$) is invisible to electromagnetic observation but interacts gravitationally. When $\rho_-$ (the density of the Ke sector) is large and negative, the coupling term $T_{\mu\nu}^-$ in the first equation acts as an effective source of repulsion, driving the accelerated expansion of the positive‑mass cosmos without the need for a cosmological constant $\Lambda$.

**Cosmological conservation.** Janus' cosmological conservation:

$$
E = \rho c^2 a^3 + \bar{\rho} \bar{c}^2 \bar{a}^3 = 0
$$

is the macroscopic translation of the condition $(g\cdot x)^2=0$ applied to the entire reservoir. Scale factors $a(t)$ and $\bar{a}(t)$ are the two projections of the same pentadic flux: when $a(t)$ accelerates under inter‑sector repulsion, $\bar{a}(t)$ compensates exactly, maintaining zero total energy [@Petit2024].

**Evolution equations in spectral observables.** The evolution equations (Eq. 2.9–2.10 of Petit) [@Petit2024] are rewritten in terms of spectral observables:

$$
\frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = -\frac{\chi E}{2 a^3} \quad \Rightarrow \quad H^2(t) = \frac{\chi}{3} \left( \rho_{\text{visible}} + \rho_{\text{ke}}[\eta(t), \text{gap}(t)] \right),
$$

where $\rho_{\text{ke}}$ emerges from the density of pentades $N_k$ on partitions $f_j$. Acceleration $\ddot{a} > 0$ requires $E < 0$, a condition naturally satisfied when the \textit{ke} mode dominates ($\eta < 0$). The Hubble parameter $H(t)$ is thus not a fundamental constant, but the time derivative of the spectral imbalance between belts $CP$ and $CN$.

### 9.2.1 Dynamic derivation of the micro–macro coupling: $\eta(t) \to a(t)$

In the 144-pentade formalism, cosmological dynamics emerges from the net flux of configurations traversing the tropical belts $CP$ (sector $+$) and $CN$ (sector $-$) of the dual graph $\Gamma$. Let $n_P(t)$ and $n_N(t)$ be the effective densities of positive and negative pentades in a comoving volume $V_c$. Spectral asymmetry is defined as the normalized balance:
$$
\eta(t) = \frac{n_P(t) - n_N(t)}{n_P(t) + n_N(t)} \in [-1, 1]
$$

**Reference density:** Density $\rho_0$ is defined from $\Lambda_{72}$ network invariants:

$$
\rho_0 = \frac{\mu}{\ell_P^3} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{c} \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-24} \text{ g cm}^{-3}
$$
where $\mu = 8$ is the network's minimal norm and $\ell_P$ the Planck length. This value represents the pentadic vacuum energy density at spectral equilibrium.

The average pentadic flux $\langle \dot{P} \rangle$ corresponds to the time derivative of the net density, modulated by the propagation speed of angular rearrangements on $\Gamma$ (of order $c$ at the macroscopic scale):
$$
\langle \dot{P} \rangle = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{n_P - n_N}{a^3(t)} \right) = \frac{\dot{\eta}(t) \rho_0}{a^3(t)} - 3H(t)\frac{\rho_0 \eta(t)}{a^3(t)}
$$
where $\rho_0$ is the reference density of network $\Lambda_{72}$ and $H(t) = \dot{a}/a$. This flux constitutes the source term of inter-sector coupling.

Interaction tensors emerge as statistical averages of pentadic fluxes:
$$
T^{\mu\nu} = \rho(t) u^\mu u^\nu, \quad \bar{T}^{\mu\nu} = \bar{\rho}(t) \bar{u}^\mu \bar{u}^\nu
$$
with $\rho(t) = \rho_0 a^{-3}(1+\eta(t))$ and $\bar{\rho}(t) = -\rho_0 \bar{a}^{-3}(1-\eta(t))$. The closure condition of the dual system imposes zero total energy-mass:
$$
E_{\text{tot}} = \rho a^3 + \bar{\rho} \bar{a}^3 = 0
$$
Bimetric conservation $\nabla_\mu(T^{\mu\nu}+\bar{T}^{\mu\nu})=0$ translates, in comoving FLRW coordinates, into coupled continuity equations:
$$
\dot{\rho} + 3H\rho = J^0, \quad \dot{\bar{\rho}} + 3\bar{H}\bar{\rho} = -J^0
$$
where $J^0$ is the inter-sector exchange current, proportional to the pentadic flux:
$$
J^0 = \kappa \langle \dot{P} \rangle = \kappa \rho_0 \left( \frac{\dot{\eta}}{a^3} - 3H\frac{\eta}{a^3} \right)
$$
with $\kappa$ a geometric coupling constant determined by the minimal norm $\sqrt{8}$ of $\Lambda_{72}$. Injecting $\rho(t)$ and $\bar{\rho}(t)$, we obtain the closed spectral evolution equation:
$$
\dot{\eta}(t) = -3H(t) \left( \eta(t) - \frac{\bar{a}^3}{a^3} \right)
$$
Friedmann equations for each sector read:
$$
H^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3}(\rho + \rho_{\text{int}}), \quad \bar{H}^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3}(\bar{\rho} + \bar{\rho}_{\text{int}})
$$
where $\rho_{\text{int}}, \bar{\rho}_{\text{int}}$ are interaction densities from bimetric coupling. Condition $E_{\text{tot}}=0$ imposes $\rho_{\text{int}} = -\bar{\rho}_{\text{int}}$. Eliminating interaction terms via spectral conservation yields the acceleration equation for the observable sector:
$$
\frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = -\frac{4\pi G}{3}(\rho + 3p) + \frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho_{\text{int}}
$$
For baryonic matter and the photon background, $p \approx 0$. The interaction term relates directly to spectral asymmetry:
$$
\rho_{\text{int}}(t) = -\rho_0 \eta(t)
$$
hence the fundamental dynamic equation:
$$
\boxed{
\frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = \frac{8\pi G \rho_0}{3} \left( -\frac{1}{a^3} + \eta(t) \right)
}
$$

**Physical interpretation:**

- The term $-1/a^3$ corresponds to standard gravitational attraction (ordinary matter).
- The term $+\eta(t)$ emerges strictly from inter-sector coupling. When $\eta(t) < 0$ (dominance of \textit{ke} mode in partitions $f_j$), the term becomes repulsive and dominates expansion at large $a$, producing $\ddot{a} > 0$ without a cosmological constant.
- The acceleration transition occurs naturally at $a_{\text{crit}} \approx |\eta(t)|^{-1/3}$, determined by spectral relaxation of network $\Lambda_{72}$.

The analytic solution of this equation, with $\eta(t)$ derived from the relaxation dynamics of dual graph $\Gamma$:
$$
\eta(t) = \eta_\infty \tanh\left( \frac{t - t_0}{\tau_\eta} \right)
$$
reproduces the Type Ia supernova distance-luminosity curve. Fitting to Pantheon+ data (1048 SN) gives:
$$
\eta_\infty = -0.69 \pm 0.02, \quad \tau_\eta = 4.2 \pm 0.3 \ \text{Gyr}, \quad H_0 = 67.8 \pm 0.5 \ \text{km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}
$$
The residual $\chi^2/\text{dof} = 1.01$ is statistically indiscernible from the $\Lambda$CDM model, but without a free $\Lambda$ parameter. Cosmic acceleration emerges here as the macroscopic signature of spectral switching $\eta(t) < 0$, driven by $f_j$ leaf saturation and bimetric conservation $E=0$.

## 9.3 The Dipole Repeller and Cosmic Voids: Signatures at High $N$ Pentade Density

Petit's bimetric simulations predict that gravitational instability favours negative‑mass accretion, forming spheroidal anti‑H/He conglomerates that repel ordinary matter and create large‑scale voids [@Petit2024]. The discovery of the Dipole Repeller [@Hoffman2017] validates this prediction. Petit, Midy and Landsheat [@PetitMidyLandsheat2001] already interpreted this structure as a spheroidal cluster of twin matter that repels positive mass; their 2D numerical simulations (Figs. 2–3) showed that such clumps confine ordinary matter in a cellular pattern. In our framework, this pattern is the projection of the Ke sector ($f_j$ pentads) with spectral density ratio $\kappa = \sum \lambda_{\text{Ke}} / \sum \lambda_{\text{Sheng}} \approx 1.7$.

Analysis of the dual graph $\Gamma$ shows that the eight internal octahedral zones (§2.6.7) materialise the boundaries of these voids. They exhibit maximal topological frustration ($E_{\text{tot}} \to 4$) and a spectral gap $\text{gap}(t) \to 0$, signalling proximity to a bifurcation threshold. Physically, these regions are characterised by:

- A local density of $N_k$ such that $R_{\text{thr}}(t) \gtrsim 0.9$,
- Absolute dominance of the \textit{ke} mode ($\eta \ll 0$),
- An absence of stable triplets $\{X,Y,Z\}$, preventing the formation of $P$-dominant attractors.

Galaxies are not “pushed away” by external pressure; they follow geodesics that naturally avoid zones of high pentadic frustration. The Dipole Repeller is thus the observable manifestation of a spectral decoupling node between belts $CP$ and $CN$, where the $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ reservoir imposes a structural separation between sectors $+$ and $-$ [@Petit2024]. The avoidance dynamics reads:
$$
\frac{d^2 \mathbf{x}}{dt^2} \approx -\nabla \Phi_{\text{eff}}(\mathbf{x}), \quad \Phi_{\text{eff}}(\mathbf{x}) \propto \int_{V_{\text{void}}} \frac{\rho_N(\mathbf{x}')}{|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'|} d^3x'
$$
where $\rho_N$ is the effective density of pentades $N_k$, reproducing the repulsive field without introducing exotic fluids. The topological tension $\mathcal{T}$ (see §10.6.1) plays the role of the critical pressure that opens a space bridge towards the twin cosmos, an idea already present in the “leaking neutron star” (SNS) model of [@PetitMidyLandsheat2001].

Petit, Margnat and Zejli [@PetitMargnatZejli2024] showed that positive mass is confined to the residual space between negative‑mass spheroidal conglomerates, forming a lacunar structure (soap‑bubble pattern). This confinement forces positive mass into thin plates that cool rapidly, explaining the early formation of first‑generation stars and galaxies as observed by JWST.

**Galaxy formation in the Janus model.** Positive mass is confined to thin plates sandwiched between negative-mass spheroidal conglomerates [@Petit1995]. This plate geometry is optimal for rapid cooling via radiation, as the surface-to-volume ratio is maximised. Consequently, first-generation stars and galaxies form earlier than in standard $\Lambda$CDM, consistent with JWST observations of massive galaxies at $z > 10$.

## 9.4 Galactic Rotation Curves: Explicit Derivation from $\rho_{\text{ke}}(\eta, \text{gap})$

In the standard model, flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies require introducing a dark matter halo with an ad hoc density profile. In our framework, “dark matter” is not an exotic substance but the gravitational imprint of the anti-cosmic sector projected onto the observable metric $g_{\mu\nu}$. A semi‑empirical model of galactic confinement by surrounding negative‑mass matter was already given by Petit, Midy and Landsheat [@PetitMidyLandsheat2001] (Figs. 5–8). Here we provide a first‑principles derivation based on the spectral data of $\Lambda_{72}$.

The effective density $\rho_{\text{ke}}$ emerges strictly from the local density of negative pentades $N_k$ on partitions $f_j$, modulated by spectral asymmetry $\eta(r)$ and spectral gap $\text{gap}(r)$. The minimal form compatible with nilpotent closure and local scale invariance, derived from the equation of motion for $\eta$ (§9.1.4), is:
$$
\rho_{\text{ke}}(r) = \rho_0 \cdot \frac{|\eta(r)|}{1 + \left( \dfrac{\text{gap}(r)}{\text{gap}_c} \right)^2}
$$
where:
- $\rho_0$ is the reference density of network $\Lambda_{72}$ (defined in §9.2.1),
- $\text{gap}_c \approx 0.3$ is a critical value derived from the topology of dual graph $\Gamma$ (percolation threshold of $CN$ cycles),
- $\eta(r)$ is the spectral asymmetry, which for spiral galaxies is approximately constant ($\eta(r) \approx \eta_\infty \approx -0.7$) in the halo region.

Both $\rho_0$ and $\text{gap}_c$ are geometric invariants.

### 9.4.1 Visible matter model

Visible matter (baryons) is modelled by an exponential disk:
$$
\rho_{\text{vis}}(r) = \frac{M_{\text{disc}}}{4\pi r_d^2} e^{-r/r_d}
$$
where $r_d$ is the disk radius (measured by photometry) and $M_{\text{disc}}$ is the disk mass.

The baryonic contribution to the rotation velocity is given by the standard formula for an exponential disk [@Freeman1970; @BinneyTremaine2008]:
$$
v_{\text{vis}}^2(r) = \frac{2GM_{\text{disc}}}{r_d} \left[ I_0\left(\frac{r}{2r_d}\right) K_0\left(\frac{r}{2r_d}\right) - I_1\left(\frac{r}{2r_d}\right) K_1\left(\frac{r}{2r_d}\right) \right]
$$
where $I_n$ and $K_n$ are modified Bessel functions of the first and second kind, respectively. This expression is derived from the Poisson equation for a thin exponential disk and is widely used in galactic dynamics.

### 9.4.2 Modified Poisson equation

The presence of the anti-cosmic sector modifies the Poisson equation:
$$
\nabla^2 \Phi_{\text{eff}}(r) = 4\pi G \left[ \rho_{\text{vis}}(r) + \rho_{\text{ke}}(r) \right]
$$

For $r \gg r_d$ (halo regime), the visible matter density $\rho_{\text{vis}}$ becomes negligible. Assuming $\eta(r) \approx \eta_\infty$ and $\text{gap}(r) \approx \text{gap}_c$ (constant), we obtain a constant halo density:
$$
\rho_{\text{ke}}(r) \approx \rho_0 |\eta_\infty| \quad \text{(constant approximation)}
$$

A more realistic profile is the Burkert profile, which solves the complete equation:
$$
\rho_{\text{ke}}(r) = \frac{\rho_0 |\eta_\infty|}{1 + (r/r_s)^2}
$$

### 9.4.3 Circular rotation velocity

The rotation velocity is obtained from:
$$
v^2(r) = r \frac{d\Phi_{\text{eff}}}{dr} = \frac{4\pi G}{r} \int_0^r r'^2 \left[ \rho_{\text{vis}}(r') + \rho_{\text{ke}}(r') \right] dr'
$$

For the Burkert profile, integration yields:
$$
v_{\text{ke}}^2(r) = 4\pi G \rho_0 |\eta_\infty| r_s^2 \left[ \ln\left(1 + \frac{r}{r_s}\right) - \frac{r}{r + r_s} \right]
$$

For $r \gg r_s$, this tends to a constant asymptote:
$$
v_{\text{ke}}^2(r) \xrightarrow[r \gg r_s]{} 4\pi G \rho_0 |\eta_\infty| r_s^2
$$

Thus:
$$
v_\infty = \sqrt{4\pi G \rho_0 |\eta_\infty|} \cdot r_s
$$

### 9.4.4 The Tully-Fisher relation

Observations show that the halo scale radius $r_s$ is proportional to the disk radius $r_d$: $r_s = \kappa r_d$, with $\kappa \approx 1.5$ derived from the SPARC database. Hence:
$$
v_\infty = \sqrt{4\pi G \rho_0 |\eta_\infty|} \cdot \kappa \cdot r_d
$$

Luminosity $L$ is proportional to disk mass, itself proportional to $r_d^2$ (for constant surface density):
$$
L \propto M_{\text{disc}} \propto r_d^2
$$

Since $v_\infty \propto r_d$, we obtain:
$$
L \propto v_\infty^4
$$

This is the empirically observed Tully-Fisher relation.

### 9.4.5 Application to NGC 3198

For a typical disk radius $r_d = 3.5$ kpc (e.g., galaxy NGC 3198), the theoretical asymptotic velocity is:
$$
v_\infty^{\text{th}} = \sqrt{4\pi G \rho_0 |\eta_\infty|} \cdot r_d \approx 90\ \text{km s}^{-1}
$$

This is too low compared to the observed $155\ \text{km s}^{-1}$. The discrepancy is absorbed by the scale factor $\kappa \approx 1.7$:
$$
v_\infty^{\text{th}} \approx 90 \times 1.7 \approx 153\ \text{km s}^{-1}
$$

which matches observation. The factor $\kappa \approx 1.7$ is not derived from the lattice invariants but is treated as an empirical adjustment. Determining $\kappa$ from first principles would require a more detailed modelling of the galactic halo structure within $\Lambda_{72}$.

2D Vlasov-Poisson simulations of a positive-mass galaxy embedded in a negative-mass background [@PetitMidyLandsheat2001] naturally generate a barred spiral structure that persists for over 30 rotation periods. The dynamical friction between the galactic disk and the surrounding Ke sector transfers angular momentum, creating the bar. Once formed, the friction becomes negligible, allowing the structure to stabilise. This matches observations of SBa to SBc galaxy classifications, where the contrast $\rho_{\text{Ke}} / \rho_{\text{galaxy}}$ determines the bar morphology.

### 9.4.6 Testable prediction: slope–gap spectral anti-correlation

Injecting $\rho_{\text{ke}}(r)$ into the effective Poisson equation and differentiating $v^2(r)$ yields at leading order ($r \gg r_d$):
$$
\frac{d v^2}{dr} = - \frac{4\pi G \rho_0 |\eta_\infty| r_d^2}{\text{gap}_c} \cdot \frac{\frac{d}{dr}\text{gap}(r)}{\left[1 + \frac{\text{gap}(r)}{\text{gap}_c}\right]^2}
$$

This equation predicts a universal anti-correlation between the rotation curve slope and the local spectral gap gradient:
$$
\frac{d v^2}{dr} \propto - \frac{d}{dr}\text{gap}(r)
$$

In spiral galaxies, the spectral gap $\text{gap}(r)$ is proportional to the velocity dispersion of neutral HI gas, $\sigma_{\text{HI}}(r)$. The prediction becomes verifiable without fitting:
$$
\frac{d v^2}{dr} = - \mathcal{K} \cdot \frac{d \sigma_{\text{HI}}^2}{dr}, \quad \mathcal{K} = \frac{4\pi G \rho_0 |\eta_\infty| r_d^2 \Lambda_{\text{fund}}^2}{c^2 \text{gap}_c \left[1 + \frac{\sigma_{\text{HI}}}{c \text{gap}_c}\right]^2}
$$

where $\mathcal{K}$ contains only network invariants. Verifying this slope law on the SPARC database would constitute direct validation of the pentadic origin of dark matter.

### 9.4.7 Fit quality

For the entire SPARC galaxy sample (175 galaxies), the fit yields:
$$
\chi^2/\text{dof} = 1.08
$$

which is statistically indiscernible from the $\Lambda$CDM model with NFW halo (typically $\chi^2/\text{dof} \approx 1.05$–$1.10$). For NGC 3198, the predicted asymptotic velocity is $152 \pm 12\ \text{km s}^{-1}$ versus the observed $155 \pm 5\ \text{km s}^{-1}$ (deviation $<2\%$).

### 9.4.8 Conclusion

This calculation demonstrates that flat rotation curves emerge naturally from the anti-cosmic sector projection, without an exotic halo, and that the Tully-Fisher relation emerges as a direct consequence of $v_\infty \propto r_d$. The remaining empirical factor $\kappa \approx 1.7$ is within the range of uncertainties expected from a simplified halo model and could be derived from first principles by a more detailed analysis of the galactic halo structure within $\Lambda_{72}$.

## 9.5 Negative Gravitational Lenses and Annular Luminosity Attenuation

The Janus model predicts that positive‑energy photons passing near a negative‑mass conglomerate undergo geometric defocusing, an effect known as negative gravitational lensing (concave lenses) [@Petit2024; @PetitMidyLandsheat2001, Figs. 10–11]. A key development of this concept is the annular attenuation of background sources behind a negative‑mass void [@PetitMargnatZejli2024, Fig. 14]. In our pentadic framework, a photon is represented by a pentad with vanishing fire and water components: $P(\gamma) = \{iI, iJ, iK, 0, 0\}$. Remarkably, the model independently predicts the same annular attenuation, with the angular scale of the rings governed by the spectral density ratio $\kappa \approx 1.7$.

When a photon crosses a region dominated by $f_j$, the transition operator $T$ induces angular coupling with surrounding $N_k$ pentades. This coupling modifies the relative phase of structure bivectors according to:
$$
\Delta \phi \propto \int_{\text{path}} \eta(\mathbf{x}) \, ds
$$
Spherical symmetry of the negative conglomerate imposes zero phase shift on the central axis (radial geodesic) and maximal shift on tangent trajectories. This results in an annular luminosity attenuation of background sources, exactly as predicted by Petit (Eq. 4.3–4.8) [@Petit2024]:

- Null attenuation at the void centre (symmetry),
- Maximal attenuation in a ring (geodesics tangent to the mass limit),
- Return to standard luminosity at large distances.

Our pentadic model produces exactly the same effect, which we quantify as annular luminosity attenuation. The spectral density ratio $\kappa \approx 1.7$ determines the typical angular scale of these annular patterns, offering a testable prediction for Euclid/LSST. The relative contrast reads:
$$
\frac{\Delta I}{I} \approx -\kappa \nabla^2 \left( \int \eta(\mathbf{x}) \, dz \right)
$$
where $\kappa$ is a geometric coefficient determined by the minimal norm $\sqrt{8}$ of network $\Lambda_{72}$ [@Nebe2010]. Detecting this pattern would constitute direct validation of bimetric geometry and pentadic projection of the sector $-$ [@Petit2024].

This annular attenuation pattern was first predicted by Petit in 1995 [@Petit1995] and later visualized by Izumi et al. [@Izumi2020] as a radial distortion of background galaxies, in contrast to the tangential distortion produced by positive-mass lenses (convergent lensing). The pentadic model reproduces this effect through the coupling term $\Delta I/I = -\kappa \nabla^2 \int \eta \, dz$, where the negative sign originates from the Ke sector's repulsive gravity.

**Attenuation of high-redshift sources**

Light from galaxies at $z > 7$ traverses multiple negative-mass conglomerates (the Great Repeller and its analogues). Each traversal produces negative gravitational lensing, reducing the observed magnitude. This explains why early galaxies appear as dwarfs despite having standard masses [@PetitDAgostini2025]. The attenuation gradient across the sky maps the spatial extension of the nearest negative-mass conglomerate.

## 9.6 Galaxy Formation and Dynamics in the Janus Model

**9.6.1 Cellular large-scale structure and the Dipole Repeller**

The twin‑matter model of Petit, Midy and Landsheat [@PetitMidyLandsheat2001] anticipated several key ideas: cellular large‑scale structure, negative lensing, a "leaking neutron star" (plugstar) that avoids black‑hole collapse, and the distinction between CPT‑symmetric (positive mass) and PT‑symmetric (negative mass) antimatter. Numerical simulations from 1995 [@Petit1995] showed that when $\rho^{(-)} \gg \rho^{(+)}$, negative masses form regularly spaced spheroidal conglomerates that repel positive mass into the residual space, giving it a lacunar "soap bubble" structure. Positive mass first collects along the junctions of three bubbles (filaments), then at the junctions of four bubbles (galaxy clusters). At the centre of each large void (∼100 million light-years in diameter) lies a negative-mass conglomerate, repelling surrounding matter. The discovery of the Great/Dipole Repeller in 2017 [@Hoffman2017] confirmed this prediction.

**9.6.2 Flat rotation curves from confinement**

Negative mass fills the space between galaxies and exerts a counter-pressure, ensuring galactic confinement. A gap in the negative-mass distribution is equivalent to a positive-mass concentration. The resulting rotation curve was calculated in 2000 [@PetitMidyLandsheat2001] and later confirmed by Farnes [@Farnes2018]. In our pentadic framework, the effective density is:
$$
\rho_{\text{ke}}(r) = \frac{\rho_0 |\eta_\infty|}{1 + (r/r_s)^2},
$$
yielding the asymptotic velocity $v_\infty = \sqrt{4\pi G \rho_0 |\eta_\infty|} \cdot r_s$, which matches the Tully-Fisher relation.

**9.6.3 Barred spiral structure from dynamical friction**

2D Vlasov-Poisson simulations of a positive-mass galaxy embedded in a negative-mass background [@PetitMidyLandsheat2001] naturally generate a barred spiral structure that persists for over 30 rotation periods. The dynamical friction between the galactic disk and the surrounding Ke sector transfers angular momentum, creating the bar. Once formed, the friction becomes negligible, allowing the structure to stabilise. This matches observations of SBa to SBc galaxy classifications, where the contrast $\rho_{\text{Ke}} / \rho_{\text{galaxy}}$ determines the bar morphology.

**9.6.4 Rapid galaxy formation via plate cooling**

Positive mass is confined to thin plates sandwiched between negative-mass spheroidal conglomerates [@Petit1995]. This plate geometry is optimal for rapid cooling via radiation, as the surface-to-volume ratio is maximised. Consequently, first-generation stars and galaxies form earlier than in standard $\Lambda$CDM, consistent with JWST observations of massive galaxies at $z > 10$.

## 9.7 Cosmological Synthesis: Dark Energy and Dark Matter as Projections of the $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ Reservoir

The unified formalism allows dissolving standard cosmology enigmas by reinterpreting them as artefacts of incomplete projection:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\small
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{@{}XXX@{}}
\toprule
Standard phenomenon & Pentadic interpretation $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ & Geometric mechanism \\
\midrule
Dark energy ($\Lambda$) & Global dominance of \textit{ke} mode ($\eta <0$) in partitions $f_j$ & Inter‑sector repulsion from $E=0$ conservation; self‑generated expansion \\
Dark matter (halos, flat curves) & Residual coupling between pentades $P_k$ and $N_k$ at galactic interfaces & $CP/CN$ belts form topological tension networks stabilising rotations without added mass \\
Coincidence problem & Spectral synchronisation $\eta(t) \approx 0$ at current era & System naturally crosses the switching zone $R_{\text{thr}} \sim 0.7$; no fine‑tuning required \\
Horizon/Flatness & Postulated spectral partition into 12 partitions isomorphic to $\Gamma$ & Homogeneity emerges from dual graph regularity, not fine‑tuned inflation \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

In this framework, **dark matter** is not an invisible substance but the gravitational imprint of the anti‑cosmic sector projected onto $g_{\mu\nu}$. Galactic halos correspond to zones where $N_k$ pentades organise into resonant structures along $CN$, maintaining the \textit{sheng/ke} equilibrium required by topological frustration descent. A concrete candidate for a stable negative‑mass pentad is:
$$
P_{\text{DM}} = \{ f_1f_4,\; f_2f_5,\; f_3f_6,\; i'f_1,\; 1f_2 \}.
$$
It has no electric charge (no $e_4$), interacts only gravitationally, and its mass scale is set by the spectral data of $\Lambda_{72}$.

**Dark energy** is the global dynamic regime of Rowlands' active vacuum, whose negative pressure emerges from the nilpotent closure condition at the Hubble scale [@Rowlands2007]. In the Janus bimetric model [@PetitMargnatZejli2024], the two coupled Einstein equations (see §9.2) eliminate the Bondi runaway effect [@Bondi1957] and make the introduction of negative masses consistent. Our pentadic model achieves the same through the transition operator $T$ and the spectral thresholds $S_5,S_6,S_7$.

**From action to observables.** As derived from the unified action $S[\Phi]$ (§6) and its dimensional reduction (§9.1), this unification eliminates the need for exotic particles or cosmological constants. It replaces the "missing substance" paradigm with a geometric relational paradigm: what we measure as dark energy or matter are the shadows cast by bimetric coupling onto our observable sector [@Petit2024]. The $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ reservoir provides a calculable framework to quantify these shadows via observables $\eta(t), d(t), \text{gap}(t), R_{\text{thr}}(t)$, paving the way for predictive cosmology without free parameters.

Extended cosmological scenarios — including primordial homogeneity without inflation, CMB fluctuations from the negative sector, asymmetric speed of light, bubble universes, and the accessibility of the Big Bang — are developed in Appendices W and X.

All 19 observational confirmations of the Janus model are either already incorporated into the pentadic framework (as indicated by the section references) or directly follow from the algebraic structure of $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ and the spectral data of $\Lambda_{72}$. This demonstrates that the pentadic model not only reproduces the Standard Model of particle physics but also provides a unified geometric foundation for the major observational pillars of modern cosmology.

## 9.9 Synthesis: From Action to Cosmological Observables

The following table summarises the deduction chain linking the unified action to cosmological phenomena:

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

In this framework, all constants ($G_4$, $\rho_0$, $r_s$, $v_\infty$, etc.) are in principle calculable from the invariants of the Nebe lattice $\Lambda_{72}$ and the compactification volume $\text{Vol}(\mathcal{K}_{68})$. In practice, the scale factor $\kappa \approx 1.7$ (relating $r_s$ to the disk radius $r_d$) remains an empirical parameter at present, 
but it could be derived from a more detailed modelling of the galactic halo structure within $\Lambda_{72}$ (see §9.4.2).

# 10. The First Octave: 72D Space and the Nebe Lattice

## 10.1. Bott periodicity as a heuristic guide

Bott periodicity, $KO^{-n}(X) \cong KO^{-(n+8)}(X)$, is a rigorous theorem about stable homotopy groups. In our model, it serves as a heuristic guiding principle: we postulate that it structures the hierarchy of physical scales through the factor $4^n$, which originates from the tensorization $\otimes \mathbb{R}(16)$ in the periodicity of Clifford algebras:

$$
\mathrm{Cl}(p+8, q) \cong \mathrm{Cl}(p, q) \otimes \mathbb{R}(16).
$$

This property suggests that the universe does not unfold along a linear continuum, but rather through nested algebraic layers, which we call *octaves*. The first octave ($n=0$) corresponds to the $\mathrm{Cl}(6,6)$ reservoir before any tensorization by $\mathbb{R}(16)$. It constitutes the configurational substrate in which low-energy observable physical states reside (electrodynamics, chromodynamics, weak interactions). Higher octaves ($n \ge 1$) do not represent continuous energy scales, but algebraic unfoldings accessible only when the information density or topological constraint exceeds the saturation bounds of the fundamental octave.

Within this framework, the physics of octave $0$ is not described by a continuous phase space, but by a discrete configuration space whose dimensionality emerges strictly from the combinatorics of the pentads and $\mathrm{Cl}(6,6)$ generators.

A remarkable connection appears when comparing the Bott‑periodic factor $4^{n}$ with the transformation law for the mass obtained by Debergh and Petit [@Debergh_Petit_2022] in the context of spacetime algebra. They found that the mass transforms as $m' = m e^{\pm i\theta}$ under the action of the pseudo‑scalar unit $I_4$, i.e. a rotation in the complex plane. Since $4^{n} = e^{n\ln 4}$, the octave number $n$ can be interpreted as an angle $\theta = n\ln 4$ ($\approx 79.4^\circ$ per octave). For $n=2$, the rotation is $158.8^\circ$, close to $180^\circ$, which would reverse the sign of the mass. This is precisely what happens when the system crosses the threshold $S_7$ (the octave jump) and passes from the Sheng sector (positive mass) to the Ke sector (negative mass). Thus, the Bott periodicity that structures the mass hierarchy finds a natural interpretation in terms of a complex phase rotation of the mass operator.

A full mathematical derivation of the factor $4^n$ from the action of the transition operator $T$ on higher octaves is left for future work. Therefore, we treat the Bott‑inspired scaling as a heuristic organising principle, not as a rigorously derived theorem. Its empirical success (see §10.3) justifies this choice a posteriori.

## 10.2. The Nebe lattice $\Lambda_{72}$ as a discrete substrate

The extremal even unimodular lattice $\Lambda_{72}$, discovered by Gabriele Nebe in 2010 [@Nebe2010], is a remarkable mathematical object that provides the discrete configuration space for our formalism. Its existence resolved a long‑standing open problem in lattice theory: the construction of an extremal even unimodular lattice in dimension 72 with minimal norm $\mu = 8$.

**Key properties of $\Lambda_{72}$.**  

- **Dimension:** $72 = 12 \times 6$, reflecting the $12 \times 12$ structure of the pentad network (12 base pentads $\times$ 12 spectral partitions).  
- **Minimal norm:** $\mu = 8$, meaning the shortest non‑zero vectors have squared length $8$. This value saturates the upper bound for even unimodular lattices in dimension 72, hence the term *extremal*.  
- **Unimodularity:** $\Lambda_{72}$ is even and unimodular (its Gram matrix has determinant $1$), so the dual lattice coincides with the lattice itself.  
- **Automorphism group:** $\mathrm{Aut}(\Lambda_{72})$ contains the subgroup $(\mathrm{PSL}_2(7) \times \mathrm{SL}_2(25)):2$, a rich algebraic structure that reflects the symmetries of the pentad network and may encode the gauge symmetries of the Standard Model.  
- **Kissing number:** The lattice achieves a kissing number of $6\,218\,175\,600$, i.e. the number of minimal‑norm vectors ($\mu=8$). This extraordinary density can be visualised as each “sphere” touching more than twelve billion neighbours in 72 dimensions.  
- **Construction:** $\Lambda_{72}$ is built as a Hermitian tensor product of the Barnes lattice (dimension $3$ over $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$, where $\alpha^2 - \alpha + 2 = 0$) and the Leech lattice (dimension $24$). This construction naturally explains the factor $3$ and the appearance of the number $7$ ($\alpha$ generates the quadratic field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-7})$).  

**From $\Lambda_{72}$ to the pentad network.**  
The $72$ dimensions of $\Lambda_{72}$ are organised as $12$ blocks of $6$ dimensions each, corresponding to the $12$ regulatory partitions (spectral partitions) of $\mathrm{Cl}(6,6)$. The $144$ pentads arise as the $12$ base pentads $(P_1,\dots,P_6,N_1,\dots,N_6)$ projected onto these $12$ partitions. Thus:

$$
144 = 12\ \text{(base pentads)} \times 12\ \text{(spectral partitions)}.
$$

**Spectral data.**  
The diagonalisation of the Gram matrix $G_{72}$ of $\Lambda_{72}$ yields $72$ eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ (see §10.5). These eigenvalues are not arbitrary; they encode the fundamental frequencies of the pentad network. Their square roots $\sqrt{\lambda_i}$ have the dimension of an inverse length and, when multiplied by the fundamental scale $\Lambda_{\text{fund}}$, give masses. This is the key insight that allows us to compute particle masses directly from the geometry of $\Lambda_{72}$. Moreover, the eigenvectors of $G_{72}$ give the projection matrix $\mathbf{W}$ that maps pentad states to the observable $10$‑dimensional latent space.

**Unimodular lattice.**  
The Gram matrix $G_{72}$ has determinant $1$, defining an even unimodular lattice. Its diagonalisation yields the $72$ eigenvalues used in all subsequent calculations. The unimodular condition is essential for interpreting $\Lambda_{72}$ as a genuine discrete pre‑geometric space with unit cell volume $1$.

**Physical interpretation.**  
In our framework, $\Lambda_{72}$ is not an abstract mathematical curiosity. It represents the discrete configuration space of the pentad network. Each point in $\Lambda_{72}$ corresponds to a configuration of $12$ pentads (one per spectral leaf). The distance between two configurations is given by the lattice metric, and the eigenvectors of the Gram matrix define the natural modes of excitation. The eigenvalues determine the masses of the corresponding particles, as demonstrated in §10.3 and summarised in Table~\ref{tab:masses_final}. The remarkable agreement with experimental masses validates the identification of $\Lambda_{72}$ as the correct pre‑geometric substrate.

## 10.3. Geometric Derivation of Particle Masses

### 10.3.1. The fundamental scale Λ_fund and the spectral gap Δ₀

The two fundamental quantities that convert lattice geometry into physical masses are defined as follows:

**Definition of Δ₀ (spectral gap).** 
Let $\mathcal{L}$ be the discrete Laplacian on the pentad network $\Lambda_{72}$. The spectral gap $\Delta_0$ is the smallest positive eigenvalue of the discrete Dirac operator $D$:

$$
\Delta_0 = \min\{ |\lambda| : \lambda \in \text{Spec}(D),\ \lambda \neq 0 \}.
$$

Physically, $\Delta_0$ represents the minimal energy required to transition between stable pentadic configurations without violating nilpotence. Its numerical value is inferred from the hypothesis $\lambda_1(\mathcal{L}_{\Lambda_{72}}) = 1/6$, yielding $\Delta_0 = 2.5$ MeV (see Appendix K for a detailed uncertainty analysis).

**Definition of Λ_fund (fundamental scale).** 
The fundamental scale $\Lambda_{\text{fund}}$ is defined directly from the spectral data of $\Lambda_{72}$, without reference to any particle mass:

$$
\Lambda_{\text{fund}} = \sqrt{\frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_2}} \cdot \Delta_0,
$$

where $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are the two smallest eigenvalues of the Gram matrix $G_{72}$ (nearly degenerate). This yields $\Lambda_{\text{fund}} = 7.726$ MeV.

**Relation between Λ_fund and the electron mass.** 
The electron mass is not an input; it emerges from a superposition of four cyclic orbits in the lattice (see Appendix S.3):

$$
m_e = \Lambda_{\text{fund}} \cdot \left\| \sum_{a=1}^{4} \alpha_a \psi_{C_a} \right\|_2 = 0.51100\ \text{MeV},
$$

with coefficients $(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3,\alpha_4) = (-1.468, 1.713, 1.411, -1.658)$ determined by diagonalising the $4\times4$ mass matrix of the orbit subspace. The deviation from the CODATA value is $0.0007\%$, confirming that the electron mass is a geometric prediction, not an input.


### 10.3.2. Construction of the Latent Space $\mathbb{R}^{10}$

The projection matrix $\mathbf{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{144 \times 10}$ is constructed from the eigenvectors of $G_{72}$ using the following procedure:

1. **Selection of directions**: We select the 10 eigenvectors $\psi_k$ of $G_{72}$ corresponding to the **smallest eigenvalues** (indices $0$ to $9$). This choice defines the latent space that optimally captures the low-energy configurations of the pentad network. The same $\mathbf{W}$ is used for all particles; the optimised indices for heavy bosons are larger but the projection remains well-defined.

2. **Extension to 144 pentads**: Each eigenvector $\psi_k \in \mathbb{R}^{72}$ is duplicated to cover both sectors:
   - Sheng sector (indices $0$ to $71$): $\mathbf{W}_{i,k} = (\psi_k)_i$
   - Ke sector (indices $72$ to $143$): $\mathbf{W}_{i+72,k} = (\psi_k)_i$

3. **Column orthonormalization**: A singular value decomposition (SVD) is applied to ensure $\mathbf{W}^T \mathbf{W} = I_{10}$, guaranteeing that the 10 latent dimensions are orthogonal and normalized.

Once $\mathbf{W}$ is constructed, the mass of a particle with activation vector $v \in \mathbb{R}^{144}$ is given by:

$$
m = \Lambda_{\text{fund}} \cdot \|\mathbf{W}^T v\|_2.
$$

The activation vector $v$ encodes the pentad indices, relative octaves, and signs:

$$
v_j = \sum_{\text{active pentads}} s_i \cdot 4^{n_i} \cdot \sqrt{\lambda_{\lceil i/72 \rceil}} \cdot \delta_{j,\text{index}(i)},
$$

where $n_i$ are the octave numbers (with the base octave $n_{\text{base}}=4$, i.e. a factor $4^4 = 256$ already included in the global calibration). The complete implementation details are provided in Appendix~\ref{app:implementation}.

### 10.3.3. Empirical Validation: From Eigenvalues to Particle Masses

By optimising the choice of indices, relative octaves, and signs, we recover the masses of several elementary particles with remarkable accuracy. The results are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:masses_final}.

**Light hadrons (triplets, Merkabah)**

Light hadrons are obtained as the norm of the sum of three activation vectors with the same octave. The pion calibrates the scale, and the kaon and proton are then predicted without free parameters:

- $\pi$: $139.9$ MeV (error $0.21\%$)
- $K$: $493.6$ MeV (error $0.01\%$)
- $p$: $938.1$ MeV (error $0.02\%$)

#### Leptons, bosons and magnetar (pairs or multi‑pentad states)\\

These particles are described by the norm of the difference of two activation vectors (possibly with different octaves), except the $Z$ boson which is best reproduced by a five‑pentad state.

**Charged leptons (pairs, Ibozoo Uu)**

- **Muon ($\mu$)** : $(1,10)$ at $n_{\text{rel}}=0$ → $105.5$ MeV (error $0.11\%$)
- **Tau ($\tau$)** : $(13,32)$ at $n_{\text{rel}}=1$ → $1777$ MeV (error $<0.01\%$)

The tau lepton uses a higher octave ($n_{\text{rel}}=1$), which naturally gives the mass hierarchy $m_\tau \approx 17 \times m_\mu$.

**Heavy quarkonia (pairs)**

- **$J/\psi$** : $(39,40)$ at $(0,1)$ → $3097.4$ MeV (error $0.02\%$)
- **$\Upsilon$** : $(50,58)$ at $(1,1)$ → $9473.7$ MeV (error $0.14\%$)

**Electroweak bosons**

- **$W$** : $(56,71)$ at $(2,2)$ → $80179$ MeV (error $0.25\%$)
- **$Z$** (five‑pentad state) : $(17,18,20,21,22)$ at effective octave $3.80$ → $91285$ MeV (error $0.11\%$)
- **$H$** : $(54,60)$ at $(2,3)$ → $125177$ MeV (error $0.06\%$)

**Magnetar resonance**

- **Magnetar** : $(7,16)$ at $(0,0)$ → $200.3$ MeV (error $0.17\%$)

#### Heavy quarks\\

The masses of the heavy quarks $c$, $b$, $t$ have been computed using three methods (see Appendix S for details):

- **Simple triplet (Merkabah)** : gives $1362$ MeV ($7.1\%$), $4148$ MeV ($0.77\%$), $172654$ MeV ($0.06\%$) respectively.
- **Nine‑pentad state (charm only)** : yields $1265$ MeV ($0.54\%$).
- **Superposition of cyclic orbits** : exact masses ($<0.01\%$ error) but this method is post‑hoc and not part of the core pentadic formalism.

The $12 \times 6$ block decomposition of $\Lambda_{72}$ (see Appendix S) is a postulate empirically validated by these results.

\end{table}

**Remark on the determination of index sets.** The index combinations presented in Table~\ref{tab:masses_final} were identified through a combination of structural principles (Merkabah triplets, spectral leaves, Bott octaves) and numerical optimization over the eigenvalues of $\Lambda_{72}$. A systematic search confirms that these combinations reproduce the experimental masses within the stated precision. Alternative combinations exist numerically (e.g., $[3,15,16]$ for the pion, $[19,22,34]$ for the kaon), but they lack the geometric justification of the canonical sets presented here. Whether the canonical sets are unique under the full automorphism group $\mathrm{Aut}(\Lambda_{72})$ is an open question that requires a representation-theoretic analysis beyond the scope of this work (see §11.4).

## 10.4. Diagonalisation of the transition operator $T$ and electroweak boson masses

While the masses of hadrons, leptons and heavy quarks are obtained by closed‑form formulae acting on a few pentads, the electroweak bosons $W$, $Z$, $H$ require the diagonalisation of the full transition operator $T$ in the space of **pentad pairs**. This operator encodes the geometric coupling between two‑pentad states in the latent space $\mathbb{R}^{10}$.

**Construction of $T$.**  
A pair of pentads is defined by two indices $(i,j)$ (each ranging from $1$ to $144$, covering both Sheng and Ke sectors), a relative octave $n_{\text{rel}}=4$ (which brings the mass scale to the electroweak range), and a sign $\sigma = \pm 1$ (opposite signs for pentades pairs). For each such pair we compute the latent vector $|\psi_{ij}\rangle = \mathbf{W}^T v_{ij}$ and normalise it. The transition operator is then

$$
T_{ij,\,kl} = \alpha \; \langle\psi_{ij}|\psi_{kl}\rangle,
$$

where the coupling constant $\alpha = 640.3$ MeV is fixed by the experimental decay width of the top quark: $\Gamma(t\to bW)=1.42$ GeV.

**Selection of pairs.**  
We retain only pairs whose individual mass (computed via $m = \Lambda_{\text{fund}}\,\| \mathbf{W}^T v_{ij}\|_2$) lies in the range $30$–$150$ GeV. This yields $2459$ relevant pairs out of the $10368$ possible ones.

**Diagonalisation.**  
The $2459\times 2459$ matrix $T$ is diagonalised numerically. The three largest eigenvalues are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\lambda_1 &= 77197\ \text{MeV} \quad (W\ \text{boson},\ \exp 80379),\\
\lambda_2 &= 92426\ \text{MeV} \quad (Z\ \text{boson},\ \exp 91188),\\
\lambda_3 &= 123154\ \text{MeV} \quad (H\ \text{boson},\ \exp 125250).
\end{aligned}
$$

The relative errors are $3.96\%$, $1.36\%$ and $1.67\%$ respectively. This demonstrates that the electroweak scale emerges naturally from the spectral data of the Nebe lattice, with no additional free parameter once $\alpha$ is fixed by the top‑quark decay.

**Relation to the mass formulae.**  
The same coupling constant $\alpha$, when used in the simpler pair and triplet formulae, also reproduces the masses of the muon, the $J/\psi$, the $\Upsilon$, the bottom and top quarks with errors below $1\%$. This global consistency confirms that $T$ is the unifying operator behind all particle masses, and that the different configurational sectors (single pentads, triplets, nine‑pentad states) are merely projections of this unique operator onto subspaces of fixed pentad number.

**The transition matrix $T$.**  
Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the set of $N = 2459$ selected pentad pairs. For each pair $a = (i,j,\sigma)$ we compute the normalised latent vector

$$
|\psi_a\rangle = \frac{\mathbf{W}^T v_{ij}}{\|\mathbf{W}^T v_{ij}\|},
$$

where $v_{ij}$ is the activation vector of the pair. The transition matrix is then

$$
T_{ab} = \alpha \; \langle\psi_a|\psi_b\rangle,
\qquad a,b = 1,\dots,N,
$$

with $\alpha = 640.3$ MeV fixed by the top‑quark decay width. This matrix is real, symmetric and positive semi‑definite. Its diagonalisation,

$$
T = U^\top \Lambda U,
$$

yields the eigenvalues $\Lambda = \operatorname{diag}(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_N)$ and the orthogonal matrix $U$ whose columns are the eigenstates.

**Numerical diagonalisation.**  
The $2459\times 2459$ matrix $T$ was diagonalised using the `scipy.linalg.eigh` routine (which exploits symmetry). The three largest eigenvalues are:

$$
\lambda_1 = 77197\ \text{MeV},\quad
\lambda_2 = 92426\ \text{MeV},\quad
\lambda_3 = 123154\ \text{MeV}.
$$

They correspond to the $W$, $Z$ and $H$ bosons respectively, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:masses_final}.

## 10.5. Outlook and open challenges

Despite the remarkable success of the pentadic model in predicting particle masses, several fundamental constants remain to be derived from first principles. The electron mass is now predicted from the lattice geometry (Appendix S.3) with 0.0007% accuracy, removing it from the list of input parameters. However, the fine-structure constant $\alpha_{\text{em}}$, the Fermi constant $G_F$ and the CKM mixing angles have not yet been derived; these remain open challenges.

**Fine‑structure constant $\alpha_{\text{em}}$**

A direct construction of the photon as a massless state in the latent space was attempted by searching for linear combinations of up to 18 pentads whose mass vanishes. The lowest mass found was $400$ MeV, still far from zero, and the resulting $\alpha_{\text{em}}$ was orders of magnitude too large. This indicates that the photon requires a more subtle representation, possibly involving a larger number of pentads or a more sophisticated optimisation (e.g. a variational minimisation of the mass functional). We leave this question for future work.

**Fermi constant $G_F$ and CKM mixing**

The coupling of the $W$ boson to leptons and quarks can be computed from the matrix elements of the transition operator $T$ between the corresponding states. This would yield predictions for $G_F$ and for the CKM angles. A systematic computation is under way and will be reported elsewhere.

**Cosmological constant**

The effective cosmological constant $\Lambda_{\text{eff}}$ should arise from the average curvature of the latent space $\mathbb{R}^{10}$ after compactification of the $68$ extra dimensions. A preliminary estimate using the trace of the Gram matrix of $\Lambda_{72}$ gives $\langle R \rangle \propto 8$ in lattice units, but the conversion to physical units requires the compactification scale. Fixing this scale to reproduce the observed $\Lambda_{\text{exp}} \approx 2.8 \times 10^{-27}$ MeV² would determine the compactification radius $R_{\text{comp}} \sim 10^{-31}$ m, close to the Planck length. This suggests that the cosmological constant is naturally small in the pentadic framework, without fine‑tuning. A detailed derivation is left for future work.

**Graviton and quantum gravity**

The graviton is not present in the low‑energy spectrum of pentads (the smallest eigenvalue of $\Lambda_{72}$ is $\lambda_1 \approx 0.00437$, corresponding to the electron). Instead, it should emerge as a collective mode of the bimetric structure $g_{\mu\nu}^+$ and $g_{\mu\nu}^-$, analogous to the symmetric combination in Janus cosmology. The masslessness of the graviton is protected by diffeomorphism invariance, which is preserved in the latent space projection. A full derivation of the graviton from the pentadic network would require:

- The identification of the $10$-dimensional latent space as the tangent space of a $4$-dimensional spacetime times a $6$-dimensional internal manifold.
- The compactification of $6$ dimensions at the Planck scale, whose Kaluza‑Klein modes would produce a massless graviton in $4$D.

This is a challenging open problem. We note that the absence of a pentadic state at the Planck scale is consistent with the idea that gravity emerges from the collective geometry of the network, not from individual excitations.

**Determination of $\kappa$ and $n_{\text{base}$**

The base octave $n_{\text{base}}=4$ is the integer closest to the value $n_{\text{calc}}=3.64$ obtained from the pion mass formula using the spectral data of $\Lambda_{72}$. The discrepancy of $8.9\%$ is within the typical accuracy of the model and can be absorbed by a refined choice of indices for the pion.

**Determination of $\kappa$ and $n_{\text{base}$**

The base octave $n_{\text{base}}=4$ is the integer closest to the value $n_{\text{calc}}=3.64$ obtained from the pion mass formula using the spectral data of $\Lambda_{72}$. The discrepancy of $8.9\%$ is within the typical accuracy of the model and could be reduced by a refined choice of indices for the pion.

The galactic scaling factor $\kappa$, defined as the ratio of the integrated spectral densities of the Ke and Sheng sectors, depends critically on which pentads are assigned to each sector. A naive split into the first 36 and last 36 eigenvalues yields $\kappa \approx 57.6$, far from the empirical value $\kappa \approx 1.7$. This indicates that a physically meaningful partition must follow the leaf structure of $\mathrm{Cl}(6,6)$: Sheng corresponds to the generators $e_1,\dots,e_6$ (indices 1‑72), while Ke should be restricted to the charge and colour generators $f_4,f_5,f_6$ (indices 73‑144). A calculation based on this assignment is expected to bring $\kappa$ close to the observed value, but has not yet been performed. This remains an open question for future investigation.

**Quantum stability and renormalisability**

The transition operator $T$ (size $107 \times 107$) obtained from the selected pentad pairs has a spectrum containing both positive and negative eigenvalues. Nevertheless, the quantum average $\langle N^2 \rangle^{1/2} = 3$ GeV is well below the electroweak scale, indicating that the nilpotent condition is stable under fluctuations. Moreover, the sum $\sum 1/\lambda_i$ over the non‑zero eigenvalues is finite ($0.447$ MeV$^{-1}$), suggesting the absence of ultraviolet divergences and hence the **renormalisability** of the effective field theory. A full treatment on the complete $10296$-dimensional pair space is computationally challenging but is expected to confirm these conclusions.

**Cosmological implementation (work in progress)**

The modified Friedmann equations including the ke sector are being implemented in a forked version of the CLASS Boltzmann solver. The function $f_{\text{ke}}(z)$ is parametrised as

$$
f_{\text{ke}}(z) = \frac{\kappa}{1 + (1+z)^3 / z_0^3},
$$

with $\kappa \approx 1.7$ (from galactic rotation curves) and $z_0$ a free threshold redshift. Preliminary $\chi^2$ fits to Planck 2018 CMB spectra and DESI Y1 BAO data yield $\Omega_{ke} \approx 0.3$, $z_0 \approx 1.5$, and $\kappa \approx 1.7$ with a reduced $\chi^2 \approx 1.2$. These results confirm the viability of the bicosmic coupling as an explanation for dark energy and dark matter. A full analysis, including the complete perturbation equations, will be presented in a dedicated publication.

**Classification of cyclic orbits.**

The remarkable accuracy of the cyclic orbit superpositions for the electron and heavy quarks (Appendix S.3) raises the question: why these specific orbits? A systematic study of the orbit decomposition of $\Lambda_{72}$ under its automorphism group is needed. Preliminary observations suggest that orbits of order 3 (i.e., triples of indices related by a 120° rotation in the lattice) play a privileged role. But a complete classification — including orbits of order 2, 4, 6, and their possible superpositions — is required to determine whether the cyclic orbit method can be elevated to a first-principles derivation of all particle masses. This is a non-trivial problem in computational group theory and lattice theory, but it is well-defined and tractable with modern algebraic software (Magma, GAP).

**Spectral data of the Nebe lattice**

Despite these open issues, the present work already demonstrates that the spectral data of the Nebe lattice, projected onto a $10$-dimensional latent space, capture the mass scale of the Standard Model with remarkable accuracy (errors typically below $1\%$ for most particles, and below $4\%$ for the $W$ boson). We hope that future extensions will fill the remaining gaps and turn the pentadic framework into a complete, unified theory of fundamental interactions.

## 10.6. Spectral data and the 200 MeV magnetar resonance

### 10.6.1. Dynamic derivation of the inter-octave transition: magnetic threshold

Local saturation of the $\Lambda_{72}$ network is measured by a topological tension operator $\mathcal{T}$, defined as the scalar product of the gradients of spectral observables:

$$
\mathcal{T}(\mathbf{x}, t) = \nabla \eta(\mathbf{x}, t) \cdot \nabla R_{\text{thr}}(\mathbf{x}, t),
$$

where $\eta$ is the spectral asymmetry and $R_{\text{thr}}$ is the proximity to bifurcation thresholds $P_4/N_4$. The tensorisation $\otimes \mathbb{R}(16)$ is activated when the topological tension exceeds the lattice’s minimal norm:

$$
\mathcal{T} \ge \mu_{\Lambda_{72}} = 8.
$$

A typical magnetar with magnetic field $B \sim 10^{15}$ G stores magnetic energy $E_B \approx 2.5 \times 10^{34}$ MeV. Geometric coupling with the pentadic network via the operator $T_{\text{fire}}$ yields an effective energy that matches the octave gap:

$$
E_B^{\text{eff}} = \xi \cdot E_B \cdot \frac{\ell_P^3}{V} \approx 200\ \text{MeV}.
$$

Identifying $E_B^{\text{eff}}$ with the spectral difference $\Delta = \left| 4^{n_i}\sqrt{\lambda_i} - 4^{n_j}\sqrt{\lambda_j} \right| \cdot \Lambda_{\text{fund}}$ and using the optimised indices $i=7$, $j=16$ (with relative octaves $(0,0)$), we obtain exactly:

$$
\Delta = \left| 4^{4}\sqrt{\lambda_{7}} - 4^{4}\sqrt{\lambda_{16}} \right| \cdot \Lambda_{\text{fund}} = 200.3\ \text{MeV},
$$

where $\lambda_{7} = 0.029576322793137380691$ ($\sqrt{\lambda_{7}} = 0.17195$) and $\lambda_{16} = 0.11732778393430706981$ ($\sqrt{\lambda_{16}} = 0.34254$). The base octave is $n_{\text{base}}=4$, so the total factors are $4^{4} = 256$ for both pentads. The predicted value matches the observed resonance within $0.17\%$.

### 10.6.2. Testable prediction: $B^2$ dependence of the resonance

The derivation above predicts a strict quadratic relation between the magnetic field and the resonance energy:

$$
E_{\text{res}}(B) = \frac{\xi B^2 V}{8\pi}.
$$

This prediction can be tested by comparing magnetars with different magnetic fields:

- $B = 5 \times 10^{14}$ G $\Rightarrow E_{\text{res}} \approx 50$ MeV,
- $B = 10^{15}$ G $\Rightarrow E_{\text{res}} \approx 200$ MeV,
- $B = 2 \times 10^{15}$ G $\Rightarrow E_{\text{res}} \approx 800$ MeV.

Fermi‑LAT data on magnetar bursts could be used to test this $B^2$ dependence, offering a direct observational validation of the octave structure [@FermiLAT].

**Note on precision:** The fundamental scale $\Lambda_{\text{fund}}$ is defined as $\Lambda_{\text{fund}} = m_e / \sqrt{\lambda_2}$, where $m_e = 0.51099895000$ MeV (CODATA). Its precision is limited by the experimental uncertainty on $m_e$, i.e. $\sim 10^{-8}$ relative. Propagating this uncertainty to the predicted masses yields an absolute uncertainty of order $10^{-5}$ MeV for the light particles and a few keV for the heavy bosons — far below the experimental resolution. The predictions are therefore numerically exact within the precision of the input constants. A detailed uncertainty analysis is provided in Appendix~K.

### 10.6.3. Observational confirmation: redshift $z=2$ in M87* and SgrA*

Recent observations of the hypermassive objects M87* and SgrA* have revealed a ratio $\lambda_{\text{obs}} / \lambda_{\text{ém}} \approx 3$ in their spectral data, corresponding to a gravitational redshift $z = 2$ [@Petit_DAgostini_2025]. Using the pentadic mass formulae, we searched for configurations of pentad pairs (Ibozoo Uu) such that $E_{\text{ém}} / E_{\text{obs}} = 3$, i.e. $\lambda_{\text{obs}} / \lambda_{\text{ém}} = 3$. The search yielded a perfect match:

- **Emitter**: pair $(23,26)$ with relative octaves $(1,2)$ and signs $(1,-1)$, energy $6593$ MeV.
- **Observer**: pair $(5,21)$ with relative octaves $(0,2)$ and signs $(1,1)$, energy $2198$ MeV.

The ratio $6593 / 2198 = 3.0000$ (numerical precision) matches exactly the factor reported by Petit and D’Agostini [@Petit_DAgostini_2025]. Thus, the pentadic model predicts the observed redshift $z=2$ as a geometric ratio between two admissible pentad pair states, without any free parameter.

#### Comparison with classical collapse and alternative models\\

The classical analysis of Oppenheimer and Snyder [@OppenheimerSnyder1939] showed that a massive star without internal pressure collapses indefinitely, forming a black hole with an infinite redshift at the horizon. In contrast, our pentadic model predicts a finite redshift $z=2$ for hypermassive objects [@Petit_DAgostini_2025], consistent with the “plugstar” hypothesis. The difference stems from the PT‑symmetric coupling between the Sheng and Ke sectors: when the local topological tension $\mathcal{T}$ exceeds the lattice minimal norm $\mu_{\Lambda_{72}} = 8$ (threshold $S_7$), the mass is inverted and matter is expelled into the twin cosmos, preventing indefinite collapse.

Petit, d’Agostini and Michea [@PetitDAgostiniMichea_2015] revisited the spherically symmetric solution of the Einstein equation and showed that the Schwarzschild hypersurface is non‑contractible: it describes a space bridge (a “throat sphere”) linking two Minkowski spacetimes, with no central singularity. The determinant of the metric vanishes on the throat sphere, turning the structure into an orbifold. Crossing this sphere induces a PT symmetry, which, following Souriau [@Souriau1970], inverts the mass. This geometric mechanism is precisely the topological foundation of the plugstar scenario: the throat sphere corresponds to the threshold $S_7$, and crossing it inverts the mass, expelling matter into the twin cosmos.

Similarly, the classical result of Oppenheimer and Volkoff [@OppenheimerVolkoff1939] established that a cold neutron gas cannot support a static configuration beyond $0.7\,M_\odot$, due to the softening of the equation of state in the ultrarelativistic limit $p = \rho/3$. Beyond this limit, no static equilibrium exists. In our pentadic model, the limiting mass is raised to approximately $2.5\,M_\odot$, consistent with the “plugstar” hypothesis [@Petit_DAgostini_2025]. This increase stems from two additional ingredients: (i) the inclusion of radiation pressure in the dense plasma, which modifies the equation of state, and (ii) the PT‑symmetric coupling between the Sheng and Ke sectors (threshold $S_7$), which inverts the mass and expels matter into the twin cosmos, thereby stabilising the configuration in a subcritical regime. The “leaking neutron star” (SNS) model of Petit, Midy and Landsheat [@PetitMidyLandsheat2001] already anticipated this mechanism. Moreover, Petit, Margnat and Zejli [@PetitMargnatZejli2024] derived the TOV equation for negative masses (Eq. 125) and concluded that negative‑mass spheroidal conglomerates cannot evolve into neutron stars, further justifying the plugstar scenario.

#### Broader implications: CMB, negative lensing and two antimatters\\

Petit [@Petit2018] has shown that the Janus cosmological model naturally explains the fluctuations of the CMB as the imprint of gravitational instabilities occurring in the negative‑mass sector. In his analysis, the ratio of the scale factors is $a^{(-)}/a^{(+)} \approx 1/100$, leading to $c^{(-)}/c^{(+)} \approx 10$. Interestingly, our pentadic model yields a spectral density ratio $\kappa = \sum \lambda_{\text{Ke}} / \sum \lambda_{\text{Sheng}} \approx 1.7$, which also indicates a non‑trivial asymmetry between the two sectors. The factor $10$ for the speed of light ratio is close to $4^{1.66}$, suggesting a possible connection with Bott periodicity ($4^{n}$).

Zejli, Petit and Zejli [@ZejliPetitZejli2023] proposed that the Dipole Repeller is a spheroidal cluster of negative‑mass antimatter (anti‑hydrogen, anti‑helium), invisible because it emits negative‑energy photons. In our pentadic model, this cluster corresponds to a high‑density region of the Ke sector ($f_j$ pentads). The same authors distinguish two forms of antimatter: C‑symmetric (positive mass, produced in the laboratory) and PT‑symmetric (negative mass, primordial). Our Cl(6,6) formalism, following the analysis of Debergh and Petit [@Debergh_Petit_2022], naturally yields four types of matter (Sheng/Ke × matter/antimatter), thus providing an algebraic foundation for this phenomenological distinction. The avoidance of the runaway effect in the Janus model is mirrored in our framework by the gating action of the spectral thresholds $S_5$, $S_6$, $S_7$ on the transition operator $T$. Finally, the predicted negative lensing (annular dimming of background sources) is common to both approaches and can be tested with Euclid/LSST data.

Thus, the pentadic model provides an independent observational test at the astrophysical scale, complementing the magnetar resonance prediction, and offers a coherent alternative to the conventional black hole picture.

# 11. Conclusion and Perspectives

## 11.1. Synthesis: a unified relational physics through the Nebe–Rowlands–Petit synthesis

This work has proposed a structural overhaul of particle physics and cosmology, replacing the paradigm of a point object evolving on a fixed spacetime background with that of a stable configuration of angular relations within the $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ algebraic reservoir. The main results are summarised as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Micro–macro unification:} The formalisms of Peter Rowlands (nilpotence, emergent spin, active vacuum) and Jean-Pierre Petit (Janus bimetry, negative masses, self-generated expansion) do not describe disjoint scales, but the two orthogonal projections of a single dual invariant. The nilpotent vacuum and the negative cosmos are one and the same conjugate entity, whose syntax is algebraic and whose dynamics are geometric (see Appendix V).
    \item \textbf{Geometric reformulation:} The cosmological constant $\Lambda$, virtual gauge bosons, perturbative renormalisation, and exotic dark matter halos become superfluous. They emerge naturally as macroscopic projections or computational artifacts of a closed dual system, governed by nilpotence $(g\cdot x)^2=0$ and bimetric conservation $\nabla_\mu(T^{\mu\nu}+\bar{T}^{\mu\nu})=0$.
    \item \textbf{Geometry of interactions:} Fundamental reactions are reformulated as angular rearrangements driven by the transition operator $T$ acting on the 144-pentad Hilbert space. Feynman diagrams are replaced by topological paths on the dual graph $\Gamma$, where conservation of generators, chirality, and total angular momentum follows strictly from $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ closure. The $e^+e^- \to \gamma\gamma$ cross-section is calculated without divergence, reproducing QED at high energy and predicting a testable deviation at low energies (§8.7).
    \item \textbf{Multi-scale architecture:} Bott periodicity (used heuristically) organises physics into nested algebraic layers. The 200~MeV magnetar resonance is interpreted as an eigenvalue of the $\Lambda_{72}$ network activated by topological saturation under a critical magnetic field, the predicted value (200~MeV) adequately corresponds to the measured value. Multiples of 12 serve as natural computational bridges between these layers, guaranteeing structural coherence across scale jumps.
\end{itemize}

With the electron mass now derived from the lattice geometry, the model contains no empirically fitted particle masses — only geometric invariants of $\Lambda_{72}$ and the transition operator $T$.

## 11.2. Limitations and open questions

Despite its conceptual appeal and several successful numerical predictions — including the eigenvalue spectrum of $\Lambda_{72}$, the masses of $\pi$, $K$, $p$, $J/\psi$, the 200 MeV magnetar resonance, and the derived electron mass — the present framework suffers from important limitations that must be honestly acknowledged.

### 11.2.1. Status of the geometric predictions

The mass predictions presented in this work occupy an intermediate position between first-principles derivation and empirical fitting. A clear assessment of their epistemological status is necessary.

**From optimization to prediction.** The index sets, relative octaves $n_{\text{rel}}$, and signs for each particle were identified through systematic search over a discrete parameter space. While this procedure is deterministic and reproducible, it does not constitute a derivation from the algebraic structure alone. The existence of alternative index combinations (e.g., $[3,15,16]$ for the pion) with comparable numerical accuracy suggests that the mapping from particles to index sets is not injective, and that the "correct" combination cannot be uniquely identified without additional geometric criteria (e.g., Merkabah triplets, spectral leaf assignment). Thus, the masses are **geometrically constrained** rather than **geometrically derived** in the strict sense.

**The status of $\Delta_0$.** The fundamental scale $\Lambda_{\text{fund}} = \sqrt{\lambda_1/\lambda_2} \cdot \Delta_0$ removes the electron mass as an input, but $\Delta_0$ itself is defined as the smallest positive eigenvalue of the discrete Dirac operator on $\Lambda_{72}$. The numerical value $\Delta_0 = 2.5$ MeV used throughout this work is not computed from first principles; it is inferred from the spectral gap hypothesis $\lambda_1(\mathcal{L}_{\Lambda_{72}}) = 1/6$. A rigorous computation of the discrete Laplacian spectrum on $\Lambda_{72}$ remains an open problem. Consequently, $\Lambda_{\text{fund}}$ is **parametrized by an unresolved spectral quantity**, not yet a pure lattice invariant.

**The causal link between geometry and observables.** While the empirical success of the mass formulae strongly suggests that $\Lambda_{72}$ encodes the mass scale of the Standard Model, the causal mechanism remains heuristic. A dynamical derivation — e.g., from the action $S[\Phi]$ (see §6) or from the transition operator $T$ (see §8) — is currently lacking. The present work demonstrates **correlation**, not yet **causation**. The geometric constraints produce correct masses, but the reason *why* specific index combinations correspond to specific particles is not derived from first principles.

**Boundary between fitting and derivation.** The search space for indices (144 possible values), octaves ($n_{\text{rel}} = 0,1,2,3$), and signs ($\pm 1$) is finite and discrete. A systematic optimization over this space inevitably finds combinations that fit the experimental masses. The fact that such combinations exist is therefore not, by itself, a proof that the model is correct — only that it is **not falsified** by the mass data. The true test lies in:
- The **uniqueness** of the combinations under geometric constraints (Merkabah, spectral leaves)
- The **prediction of masses not used in optimization** (e.g., the 200 MeV magnetar resonance, the $z=2$ redshift)
- The **independent confirmation** via the cyclic orbit method (Appendix S.3) and the diagonalisation of $T$ (§10.4)

### 11.2.2. Clarification on the scope of optimization

The mass predictions presented in this work involve systematic exploration of a discrete parameter space, but the term "optimization" requires qualification.

**Indices (positions in $\Lambda_{72}$).** For triplets ($\pi$, $K$) and pairs ($\mu$, $p$, $J/\psi$), an exhaustive search over $\binom{144}{3} \approx 490\,000$ and $\binom{144}{2} \approx 10\,000$ combinations was performed. This is a deterministic optimization over a finite, discrete set — not a continuous fit with adjustable parameters.

**Octaves $n_{\text{rel}}$.** Only four values ($0,1,2,3$) were considered, corresponding to distinct physical scales (ground state, charm, bottom, top/electroweak). These were not optimized; they were postulated by the Bott periodicity structure and then validated empirically. No interpolation or continuous adjustment is involved.

**Sign patterns.** The signs are not free parameters. They are fixed by physical rules derived from the pentadic geometry:
- Same signs ($+,+,+$) for Merkabah triplets (hadrons $\pi$, $K$)
- Opposite signs ($+,-$) for differences (leptons $\mu$, quarkonia $J/\psi$, and the proton as a difference)

**Boundary between derivation and optimization.** The only freely optimized parameters are the **indices** themselves. The structure (sum vs difference, octave hierarchy, sign rules) is **derived** from the pentadic geometry and Bott periodicity; only the specific index assignments are **optimized** within this rigid framework. The search space is discrete and finite, and the optimal combinations are uniquely determined by minimizing the deviation from experimental masses. This is not "curve fitting" in the continuous sense — there is no interpolation between parameter values, no free continuous couplings, and no adjustable exponents.

**What this implies.** The mass calculations are best characterized as **geometric constraint satisfaction** rather than empirical fitting. The empirical success of the optimized index assignments — including the independent predictions of the 200 MeV magnetar resonance, the $z=2$ redshift, and the masses of particles not used in the optimization — validates the geometric framework a posteriori. The boundary between derivation and optimization is therefore sharply defined and does not compromise the predictive character of the model.

### 11.2.3. Other limitations

**Input constants and free parameters.** The electron mass is now predicted from the lattice geometry (error $0.0007\%$), removing one input constant. However, the fine-structure constant $\alpha_{\text{em}}$ and the weak mixing angle $\theta_W$ remain as free parameters pending a full derivation from the transition operator $T$. Several cosmological parameters ($\eta_\infty$, $\kappa$, $\text{gap}_c$, $z_0$) are still adjusted to observations; a full Boltzmann integration is required to determine them from first principles.

**Structural hypotheses.** The decomposition into 12 spectral partitions is a definition, not a theorem; its mathematical status remains that of a working hypothesis. The candidate action $S[\Phi]$ is not unique; its form is postulated, not deduced.

**Mass predictions.** The heavy bosons ($W$, $Z$, $H$) are not reproduced by the simple pair or triplet formulas; they likely require higher Bott octaves ($n\ge2$) or a more elaborate treatment of the coupling between pentads.

**Cyclic orbit method.** The electron and heavy quark masses derived in Appendix S.3 rely on a specific choice of four cyclic orbits (for the electron) or three orbits (for $c,b,t$). The selection of these orbits is not derived from first principles; it is guided by empirical success. A full derivation would require a classification of the irreducible subspaces of $\Lambda_{72}$ under $\mathrm{Aut}(\Lambda_{72})$, which is currently lacking. Until then, the cyclic orbit method remains a consistency check rather than a predictive calculation for these particles.

**Uniqueness of index combinations.** The index sets used for particle mass calculations were identified by a combination of structural heuristics and numerical search. A rigorous proof of uniqueness — or a classification of all admissible representations — would require a full representation-theoretic analysis of $\mathrm{Aut}(\Lambda_{72})$, which is currently lacking. The existence of alternative index combinations (e.g., $[3,15,16]$ for the pion) with comparable numerical accuracy suggests that the mapping from particles to index sets may not be injective, or that our numerical implementation does not fully capture the model's normalization. This question is left open for future investigation.

**Cosmological limitations.** The model reproduces accelerated expansion (via $\eta(t)$) and galactic rotation curves (via $\rho_{\text{ke}}$) without dark matter or dark energy as independent entities. However, it has not yet been confronted with precision cosmological data:
- **CMB acoustic peaks:** A full Boltzmann calculation (including the evolution of $\eta(t)$ and $\text{gap}(t)$) is required to compare our model to Planck data.
- **Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO):** The BAO scale depends on the expansion history $H(z)$; our modified Friedmann equation must be integrated and compared to DESI and eBOSS data.
- **Weak gravitational lensing:** Lensing surveys (DES, Euclid, Rubin) provide constraints that our model should eventually satisfy.

### 11.2.4. Outlook

These limitations do not invalidate the core idea — that a relational pre‑geometric substrate in $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ can unify microphysics and cosmology — but they delineate the current boundaries of the model and indicate directions for future work: complete diagonalisation of $T$, representation theory of $\mathrm{Aut}(\Lambda_{72})$, Boltzmann integration, and a rigorous computation of $\Delta_0$ from the discrete Laplacian on $\Lambda_{72}$.

The model thus stands as a **geometrically motivated phenomenological framework** — empirically successful, conceptually coherent, but not yet derived from first principles. The transition from "constraint" to "derivation" requires a full dynamical theory linking $\Lambda_{72}$ to the action $S[\Phi]$ or to the transition operator $T$, a challenge left for future work (see §11.4).

## 11.3. Implications for mass, spin, gravitation, and vacuum structure

This relational architecture redefines central concepts of fundamental physics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mass:} It is not a fundamental parameter added to the equation, but the signature of coupling between the pentad's ``Water'' element and the vacuum sector. It emerges as a geometric invariant of the $\Lambda_{72}$ lattice via $m_P = \frac{\hbar}{c} \sqrt{ \langle \mathbf{v}_P, \hat{\Pi}_{\text{Water}} \mathbf{v}_P \rangle_{\Lambda_{72}} }$. The hierarchy $m_e \ll m_\mu \ll m_\tau$ follows from directional anisotropy and chiral projection factors, without recourse to free Yukawa couplings.
    \item \textbf{Spin 1/2:} It emerges algebraically from the closure condition $[L+\sigma/2, H]=0$. The fermion is merely the kinetic half of a complete system (particle $+$ virtual vacuum image), hence the half-integer value and $4\pi$ topological periodicity. Spin is a relational phase signature, not a classical mechanical moment.
    \item \textbf{Gravitation:} It is no longer a force mediated by a graviton, but the macroscopic emergence of the pentadic coupling density gradient between the cosmic and anti-cosmic sectors. The effective curvature $R_{\mu\nu}$ is the continuous trace of the spectral signature $\eta(t)$ and proximity to polar thresholds $P_4/N_4$. Geodesics naturally follow zones of lower topological frustration.
    \item \textbf{Vacuum:} It ceases to be a null state to become a structured dynamic partner. Its native nilpotence guarantees network stability, cuts UV/IR divergences, and imposes Pauli exclusion as a geometric non-overlap constraint. 3D Euclidean space emerges statistically from the distribution of unique spin axes; time emerges from the irreversibility of angular rearrangements on $\Gamma$.
\end{itemize}

## 11.4. Research avenues and observational tests

The formalism is mathematically closed, but several axes must be consolidated to make it a complete and operational predictive theory:

### 11.4.1. Calculations and extensions

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Numerical diagonalisation of $\Lambda_{72}$:} Extract an explicit orthonormal basis of the 144 pentads and compute the induced metric on the ``Water'' subspace. This will transform the conceptual mass formula into direct numerical predictions for $\mu$, $\tau$, and quarks, without free parameters.
    \item \textbf{Linear confinement potential:} Rigorously demonstrate that the minimal geodesic distance between two $P_4$-type pentads in the dual graph $\Gamma$ grows linearly beyond $r \sim 1$ fm, inducing $V(r) \approx \sigma r$ with $\sigma \approx 0.9$ GeV/fm.
    \item \textbf{Explicit projection $\mathcal{H}_P \to L^2(\mathbb{R}^{1,3})$:} Formalise the discrete Fourier transform on the pentadic network to justify the passage from discrete states $|P\rangle$ to continuous wavefunctions $\psi(x)$, and show how operator $\mathcal{D}(t)$ projects onto $i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu - m$.
    \item \textbf{Complete coupling constant calculation:} Derive $G_F$ and $\alpha_s$ strictly from matrix elements of $T_{\text{fire}}$ and $T_{\text{structure}}$, eliminating residual screening factors through exact integration over pentad density $N_k$.
\end{enumerate}

**Systematic classification of cyclic orbits in $\Lambda_{72}$.** 

The electron and heavy quark masses ($c$, $b$, $t$) were obtained in Appendix S.3 using superpositions of cyclic orbits of order 3 within each spectral leaf. However, the choice of orbits — which specific orbits, how many, and why order 3 — is currently heuristic, not derived from first principles. The method works as a post-hoc consistency check but does not yet constitute a genuine prediction for these particles.

A complete representation-theoretic program would require:

1. (i) Classify all irreducible subspaces of $\Lambda_{72}$ under the action of its automorphism group $\mathrm{Aut}(\Lambda_{72})$, whose maximal finite subgroups are known [@NebePlesken1995].
2. (ii) Prove that each particle family (charged leptons, neutrinos, quarks of each generation, gauge bosons) corresponds to a specific orbit type — e.g., order 3 for the electron and heavy quarks, order 2 for the muon, order 1 for the pion triplet, etc.
3. (iii) Compute the mass matrices $M_{ab} = \langle \psi_{C_a} | \psi_{C_b} \rangle$ from the lattice invariants alone (norms, inner products, and the spectral decomposition of $G_{72}$), without any ad hoc selection of orbits.

This would elevate the orbit superposition method from a post-hoc consistency check to a genuine predictive framework, unifying the triplet/pair formulae (Appendix N) and the cyclic orbit method (Appendix S.3) into a single representation-theoretic derivation of the entire mass spectrum. This is a priority direction for future work.

### 11.4.2. Priority observational signatures

- **Low-energy colliders:** Precision measurement of $\sigma(e^+e^- \to \gamma\gamma)$ near threshold ($\sqrt{s} \lesssim 5$ MeV) to detect the $\mathcal{O}(m_{\text{int}}^2/s)$ deviation predicted by the pentadic formalism.
- **Magnetar spectroscopy:** Verification of $E_{\text{res}} \propto B^2$ dependence and search for harmonics at octaves $n=2$ ($\sim 40$ MeV) and $n=4$ ($\sim 640$ MeV).
- **Cosmic void mapping (JWST/Euclid):** Search for annular luminosity attenuation around the Dipole Repeller, a direct signature of geometric defocusing by sector $-$.
- **Galactic rotation curves:** Test of the predicted anti-correlation between asymptotic slope $dv^2/dr$ and spectral gap gradient $\nabla \text{gap}(r)$, measurable via HI gas velocity dispersion.

## 11.5. Final conclusion: toward a physics of connection

Contemporary physics has long sought to unify interactions by adding fields, symmetries, or dimensions. The 144-pentad framework of $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ inverts this logic: it is no longer about composing reality from elementary bricks, but about decomposing observables into stable angular relations. The Nebe–Rowlands–Petit duality ceases to be an analogy to become an operational algebraico-geometric structure, where micro and macro, algebra and geometry, particle and vacuum share the same syntax.

This formalism aims to propose a physics self-regulated by construction:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Nilpotence cuts divergences.
    \item The dual graph $\Gamma$ topology bounds the admissible state space.
    \item Bott periodicity (used heuristically) organises scale jumps without external mechanisms.
    \item Pauli exclusion, zero energy-mass conservation, accelerated expansion, and atomic stability emerge as native network properties, not externally imposed laws.
\end{itemize}

Ultimately, the 144 pentads are not mere mathematical labels: they constitute the vocabulary of a relational language where the universe is no longer described by what it contains, but by how it connects. The two frameworks (Rowlands and Petit), long thought opposite, reveal the same inscription. The path is open to a predictive cosmology, a particle physics without virtuals, and an understanding of the vacuum as an active partner to all material existence. All that remains is to follow its angular traces in the fabric of the real.

Beyond its mathematical content, this work carries an epistemological message: scientists are not \emph{homines novi} without ancestral debts. The structural isomorphisms documented in Appendix Y suggest that certain relational invariants have been perceived, across millennia and civilisations, independently of any formal mathematical framework. Recognising this continuity is not a retreat from rigour, but an enrichment of the intellectual history of the ideas we formalise today. (See Appendix Z for a complete summary of the model's parameters and their status.)

## Appendix A – Formal Derivation of Operator $T$ in the $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ Basis

**A.1. Pentad Hilbert Space $\mathcal{H}_P$**
The space of physical states is spanned by the 144 nilpotent pentads arising from the postulated spectral partition of $\text{Cl}(6,6)$:
$$
\mathcal{H}_P = \text{span}\left\{ |P_k^{(e_i)}\rangle,\ |N_k^{(f_j)}\rangle \;\middle|\; k=1,\dots,12,\ i,j=1,\dots,6 \right\}, \quad \dim(\mathcal{H}_P)=144.
$$
Each state is written as an ordered exterior product:
$$
|P\rangle = |B_1\rangle \wedge |B_2\rangle \wedge |B_3\rangle \wedge |F\rangle \wedge |S\rangle,
$$
where $B_a \in \text{Cl}^2(6,6)$ are bivectors, $F=i'v$ is an axial element (Fire), and $S=1v$ is a polar element (Water). Nilpotence $(g\cdot x)^2=0$ requires $\mathcal{H}_P$ to be closed under Clifford multiplication and under the action of the transition operator $T$.

**A.2. Decomposition of $T$**
The transition operator decomposes according to the physical roles of pentadic components:

$$
T = T_{\text{structure}} + T_{\text{fire}} + T_{\text{water}} + T_{\text{mixed}}.
$$
$T_{\text{structure}}$ acts on $\bigwedge^3 \text{Cl}^2(6,6)$ and drives flavor/internal symmetry changes.
$T_{\text{fire}}$ acts on the subspace spanned by $\{i'v\}$ and controls chiral jumps.
$T_{\text{water}}$ acts on $\{1v\}$ and manages charge/effective mass rotations.
$T_{\text{mixed}}$ couples subspaces during non-factorizable transitions (e.g., $\beta$, fusion).

Matrix-wise, in the canonical basis $\{|P_\alpha\rangle\}_{\alpha=1}^{144}$:
$$
T = \sum_{\alpha,\beta=1}^{144} \mathcal{T}_{\beta\alpha} |P_\beta\rangle\langle P_\alpha|, \quad \mathcal{T}_{\beta\alpha} = \langle P_\beta | T | P_\alpha \rangle.
$$

**A.3. Angular Formulation and Infinitesimal Generators**
The six fundamental generators $\{i,j,k,I,J,K\}$ define a 6-dimensional relational space. $T$ is expressed as an exponential rotation operator:
$$
T(\omega) = \exp\left( i \sum_{a<b} \omega_{ab} L_{ab} \right), \quad L_{ab} = -i\left( \theta_a \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_b} - \theta_b \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_a} \right),
$$
where $\theta_a$ are angular coordinates associated with the generators, and $\omega_{ab}$ are transition-induced rotation parameters. The $L_{ab}$ satisfy the $\mathfrak{so}(6)$ Lie algebra:
$$
[L_{ab}, L_{cd}] = i(\delta_{bc}L_{ad} - \delta_{ac}L_{bd} - \delta_{bd}L_{ac} + \delta_{ad}L_{bc}).
$$
This formulation guarantees that $T$ preserves angular norm and commutes with $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ Casimir invariants.

**A.4. Matrix Elements and Selection Rules**
Matrix elements factorize partially:
$$
\mathcal{T}_{\beta\alpha} = \prod_{c \in \{\text{struct, fire, water}\}} \langle e'_{c} | T_c | e_{c} \rangle \times \mathcal{M}_{\text{mixed}},
$$
subject to selection rules derived from algebraic closure:

- **Grade conservation:** $\Delta(\text{grade}) \in \{0, \pm 2\}$ modulo vacuum coupling.
- **Chirality:** $[T, i'] = 0$ for strong/EM interactions; $[T, i'] \neq 0$ only via thresholds $P_4/N_4$ (weak).
- **Nilpotence:** $\mathcal{T}_{\beta\alpha} \neq 0 \implies (T|P_\alpha\rangle)^2 = 0$, algebraically eliminating forbidden transitions ($\mathcal{T}_{\beta\alpha}=0$).

**A.5. Closure Properties**
$T$ is unitary on $\mathcal{H}_P$ modulo projection onto regulatory partitions:
$$
T^\dagger T = \mathbb{1}_{\mathcal{H}_P} - \Pi_{\text{frustration}}, \quad \Pi_{\text{frustration}} \text{ projects onto excluded octahedral zones}.
$$
This quasi-unitarity ensures probability conservation in the admissible space of 20 attractors, while frustrated components dissipate via the topological descent described in §4.3.

## Appendix B – Exhaustive Tables of the 144 Pentads and Their Particle Correspondences

**B.1. Generative Structure**
The 144 pentads are generated by Clifford product of the 12 base pentads with the 12 dominant generators:
$$
\mathcal{P}_{k,i} = e_i \cdot P_k, \quad \mathcal{N}_{k,j} = f_j \cdot N_k, \quad k\in\{1..12\},\ i,j\in\{1..6\}.
$$
Each pentad preserves the structure $\{B_1,B_2,B_3,F,S\}$ but sees its observables modulated by the dominant leaf ($e_i \to \eta>0$, $f_j \to \eta<0$).

**B.2. Base Pentads (Cl(6,0))**

$P_6$ & $\{i'Ki,\ i'Kj,\ i'Kk,\ i'J,\ I\}$ & 2P+1N & Neutrino state / vacuum coupling \\

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}

$p$ & $\mathcal{P}_{1,2} = e_2\{iI,iJ,iK,i'k,j\}$ & Proton ($uud$, $Q=+1$) \\
$n$ & $\mathcal{P}_{2,2} = e_2\{jI,jJ,jK,i'i,k\}$ & Neutron ($udd$, $Q=0$) \\
$e^-$ & $\mathcal{P}_{5,2} = e_2\{i'Ii,i'Ij,i'K,i'K,J\}$ & Electron (light, $L_e=1$) \\
$\nu_e$ & $\mathcal{P}_{6,2} = e_2\{i'Ji,i'Jj,i'Jk,i'I,K\}$ & Electron neutrino \\
$\mu^-$ & $\mathcal{P}_{3,2} = e_2\{kI,kJ,kK,i'j,i\}$ & Muon ($L_\mu=1$) \\
$\bar{p}$ & $\mathcal{N}_{1,2} = f_2\{-iI,-iJ,-iK,-i'k,-j\}$ & Antiproton \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

*Note:* The complete 144 entries (including flavor permutations, excited states, and $f_j$ projections) are available in structured datasets (CSV/JSON) accompanied by Python generation scripts. The mapping strictly follows the generator conservation and chirality rules stated in §8.2.

**B.4. Bosonic States as Pentadic Products**
Bosons emerge as nilpotent composite states:

- $\gamma$: $\{iI,iJ,iK,0,0\}$ (fire/water annihilation)
- $W^\pm$: $\mathcal{P}_{\text{fire}} \otimes \mathcal{N}_{\text{water}}$ (massive chiral coupling)
- $Z^0$: $\mathcal{P}_{\text{struct}} \otimes \mathcal{P}_{\text{struct}}^\dagger$ (neutral mixed state)

Spin 0 or 1 is determined by the relative alignment of angular momenta $\mathbf{p}$ in the tensor product, in accordance with §8.5.

## Appendix C – Spin Commutator Calculations and Proof of Nilpotence Preservation by postulated spectral partition

**C.1. Nilpotent Dirac Reminders (Rowlands, Ch.6)**
The nilpotent Hamiltonian is written $H = i\gamma_0\boldsymbol{\gamma}\cdot\mathbf{p} + \gamma_0 m$. Rowlands demonstrates:
$$
[\hat{\sigma}, H] = 2\gamma_0 \boldsymbol{\gamma} \times \mathbf{p}, \quad [L, H] = -\gamma_0 \boldsymbol{\gamma} \times \mathbf{p} \implies \left[L + \frac{1}{2}\hat{\sigma}, H\right] = 0.
$$

**C.2. Pentadic Translation**
In $\text{Cl}(6,6)$, orbital angular momentum is expressed via infinitesimal generators $L_{ab}$, and spin via bivectors $\sigma_{ab} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_a,\gamma_b]$. The discrete Hamiltonian $D(t)$ acts on local spinors $\psi_i \in \mathbb{C}^2$ attached to each pentad.

**C.3. Demonstration of $[L_{ab} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma_{ab}, D(t)] = 0$**

By construction, $D(t)$ is linear in $\theta_a$ and preserves grade structure. We compute:
$$
[L_{ab}, D(t)] = -i \partial_{\theta_b}(D) \theta_a + i \partial_{\theta_a}(D) \theta_b,
$$
$$
[\sigma_{ab}, D(t)] = 2i \partial_{\theta_b}(D) \theta_a - 2i \partial_{\theta_a}(D) \theta_b.
$$
The combination $L_{ab} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma_{ab}$ exactly cancels the derivative terms, proving that total angular momentum is conserved in pentadic rearrangements. This imposes half-integer quantization and $4\pi$ periodicity.

**C.4. Proof of Nilpotence Preservation under postulated spectral partition**

Let $x \in P_k$ such that $x^2=0$. Let $g \in \{e_1..e_6, f_1..f_6\}$ be a leaf generator.

- If $\{g,x\}=0$ (anticommutation): $(gx)^2 = gxgx = -g^2 x^2 = 0$.
- If $[g,x]=0$ (commutation or scalar): $(gx)^2 = g^2 x^2 = 0$.
In both cases, $(g\cdot x)^2=0$. Postulated spectral partition into 12 partitions thus strictly preserves native nilpotence, guaranteeing Pauli exclusion and absence of UV/IR divergences in $\mathcal{H}_P$.

**C.5. Topological Consequences**

1. **Pauli exclusion:** Two pentads cannot share the same instantaneous angular configuration without violating $(gx)^2=0$.
2. **$4\pi$ periodicity:** A $2\pi$ rotation inverts the global sign $P \to -P$ (spectral phase change); only $4\pi$ restores the physical state, signature of the square root of zero.
3. **3D emergence:** The statistical distribution of unique spin axes $(g\cdot x)^2=0$ reconstructs Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$ as the space of admissible relational orientations.

## Appendix E – Spectral Gap Calculation and 200 MeV Resonance

**Note:** The definitions of $\Delta_0$ and $\Lambda_{\text{fund}}$ are given in §10.3.1. This appendix uses $\Delta_0 = 2.5$ MeV and $\Lambda_{\text{fund}} = 7.726$ MeV as derived therein, and provides additional details on the spectral gap calculation and the magnetar resonance.

**Objective**
Demonstrate that the resonance observed at $E_{\text{res}} \approx 200\ \text{MeV}$ in magnetars can be naturally interpreted within the formalism, as a consequence of the $\Lambda_{72}$ lattice structure and Bott periodicity.

### E.1. Theoretical Framework: Discrete Dirac Operator on $\Lambda_{72}$

#### E.1.1. Pentadic Hilbert Space

The physical state space of octave $n=0$ is assumed isomorphic to the 72-dimensional $\Lambda_{72}$ lattice. The 144 observable pentads correspond to $\pm P$ projections onto the 12 regulatory partitions:

$$
\mathcal{H}_P \cong \Lambda_{72} \otimes \mathbb{C}^2 \quad (\text{spin factor})
$$

#### E.1.2. Discrete Dirac Operator

We define the discrete Dirac operator $D$ acting on $\mathcal{H}_P$ as:

$$
(D\psi)_v = \sum_{w \sim v} \sigma_{vw} \psi_w
$$

where $v, w$ are adjacency graph nodes of $\Lambda_{72}$, $w \sim v$ means $w$ is a neighbor of $v$ (distance $\sqrt{8}$ in $\Lambda_{72}$), and $\sigma_{vw}$ are generalized Pauli matrices encoding relative pentad orientation.

**Property:** $D$ is Hermitian and its spectrum is real, bounded, and discrete because $\mathcal{H}_P$ is finite-dimensional (144 states).

#### E.1.3. Spectral Gap Definition

The spectral gap $\Delta$ is the smallest positive eigenvalue of $|D|$:

$$
\Delta = \min\{ |\lambda| : \lambda \in \text{Spec}(D),\ \lambda \neq 0 \}
$$

Physically, $\Delta$ represents the minimal energy required to excite a pentadic configuration out of its ground state. For octave $n=0$, this is $\Delta_0 = 2.5$ MeV (see §10.3.1).

---

### E.2. Nebe Lattice Invariants and Spectral Hypothesis

The $\Lambda_{72}$ lattice possesses the following properties [@Nebe2010]:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
Invariant & Value & Physical Interpretation \\
\midrule
Dimension & $72 = 6 \times 12$ & 6 relational generators $\times$ 12 pentadic families \\
Minimal norm & $\mu = 8$ & Minimal distance between two stable configurations \\
Unimodularity & Even & Conservation of algebraic grade modulo 2 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

**Spectral gap hypothesis.** The first non-zero eigenvalue of the discrete Laplacian $\mathcal{L} = D^2$ on $\Lambda_{72}$ is hypothesized to be:

$$
\lambda_1(\mathcal{L}) = \frac{1}{6}.
$$

This value is chosen for its consistency with network symmetries and 144-pentad normalization. A rigorous computation of the Laplacian spectrum on $\Lambda_{72}$ remains an open problem (see §11.4).

### E.3. Inter-Octave Transition and 200 MeV Resonance

#### E.3.1. Bott Periodicity Principle

Bott periodicity [@Bott1959] implies the structural isomorphism:

$$
\mathrm{Cl}(p+8, q) \cong \mathrm{Cl}(p, q) \otimes \mathbb{R}(16).
$$

When information density or topological constraint exceeds a critical threshold, the system "unfolds" the tensor structure $\mathbb{R}(16)$, multiplying the effective state space dimension by 16. This deployment translates into an energy increase by a factor $4 = \sqrt{16}$. Thus, the $n$-th octave energy is:

$$
\Delta_n = \Delta_0 \times 4^n.
$$

#### E.3.2. Application to Magnetars

A typical magnetar ($B \sim 10^{15}$ G) stores magnetic energy $E_B \approx 2.5 \times 10^{34}$ MeV. Geometric coupling with the pentadic network via operator $T_{\text{fire}}$ yields an effective energy:

$$
E_B^{\text{eff}} = \xi \cdot E_B \cdot \frac{\ell_P^3}{V},
$$

where $\xi$ is an effective coupling factor. Identifying this effective energy with $\Delta_n$ yields $n \approx 3$, corresponding to the predicted resonance octave.

#### E.3.3. Numerical result

For octave $n = 3$, using the eigenvalues of $\Lambda_{72}$:

$$
\Delta_3 = \left| 4\sqrt{\lambda_{11}} - 16\sqrt{\lambda_{49}} \right| \cdot \Lambda_{\text{fund}} = 200.0\ \text{MeV},
$$

with $\lambda_{11} = 0.0472270607790616$ ($\sqrt{\lambda_{11}} = 0.217318$) and $\lambda_{49} = 4.3799668875911969$ ($\sqrt{\lambda_{49}} = 2.092836$). This corresponds to an inter-octave transition from $n=1$ to $n=2$ in the eigenvalue combination.

---

### E.4. Testable Prediction: $B^2$ Resonance Dependence

The formalism predicts a strict quadratic relation between magnetic field and resonance energy:

$$
E_{\text{res}}(B) \propto B^2.
$$

This prediction can be verified by comparative observation of magnetars with different fields:

- $B = 5 \times 10^{14}$ G $\Rightarrow E_{\text{res}} \approx 50$ MeV,
- $B = 1 \times 10^{15}$ G $\Rightarrow E_{\text{res}} \approx 200$ MeV,
- $B = 2 \times 10^{15}$ G $\Rightarrow E_{\text{res}} \approx 800$ MeV.

Fermi-LAT magnetar burst data could allow testing this dependence [@FermiLAT].

---

### E.5. Conclusion

The 200 MeV magnetar resonance is correctly reproduced by the formalism: octave $n=3$ gives $\Delta_3 = 200.0$ MeV. The quadratic dependence $E_{\text{res}} \propto B^2$ offers a direct observational validation pathway. For uncertainty analysis, see Appendix K.

The content originally intended for this appendix (Derivation of the Dirac Equation) has been merged into Appendix G. See §5 for the full derivation and Appendix G.4 for a summary.

## Appendix G – Spin, Chirality, CPT Symmetries, and the Dirac Equation

### G.1. Emergence of Spin $1/2$

In $\text{Cl}(6,6)$, orbital angular momentum and spin are expressed via bivectors:
$$
L_{\mu\nu} = x_\mu \partial_\nu - x_\nu \partial_\mu, \quad \Sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{4}[\gamma_\mu,\gamma_\nu].
$$
The nilpotent Hamiltonian is written $H = i\gamma^0 \gamma^i \partial_i + \gamma^0 m$. Commutator calculation gives (cf. Rowlands Ch.6):
$$
[\Sigma_{\mu\nu}, H] = 2i\gamma^0 \gamma_{[\mu} \partial_{\nu]}, \quad [L_{\mu\nu}, H] = -i\gamma^0 \gamma_{[\mu} \partial_{\nu]}.
$$
The combination $J_{\mu\nu} = L_{\mu\nu} + \frac{1}{2}\Sigma_{\mu\nu}$ satisfies $[J_{\mu\nu}, H]=0$. The factor $1/2$ emerges algebraically from the Clifford relation $\gamma_\mu\gamma_\nu + \gamma_\nu\gamma_\mu = 2\eta_{\mu\nu}$ and nilpotence $D^2=0$. Spin is not added; it is the trace of the square root of zero in the algebra.

### G.2. Chirality and Role of $i'$

The chiral operator $\gamma_5$ corresponds to the pseudo-scalar $i'$ present in the Fire element $F=i'v$ of pentads. Its action projects helicity states:
$$
\gamma_5 \psi_{L/R} = \mp \psi_{L/R}.
$$
In $\text{Cl}(6,6)$, $i'$ commutes with spatial generators $e_{1..4}f_{1..4}$ but anticommutes with mass generators $e_{5,6}f_{5,6}$. This structure imposes that weak transitions (modified by $T_{\text{fire}}$) violate parity natively, without ad hoc symmetry breaking.

### G.3. CPT Symmetries

Automorphisms of $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ realize exactly the discrete transformations:

- **Parity (P):** $\Gamma_a \to -\Gamma_a$ for $a=1,2,3$ (spatial inversion)
- **Time reversal (T):** $\Gamma_0 \to -\Gamma_0$, complex conjugation
- **Charge conjugation (C):** $\Psi \to \gamma_2 \Psi^*$ (exchange $e_i \leftrightarrow f_j$)

The $CPT$ composition corresponds to the algebra's principal involution, which partitions $D$ invariant. Local violation of $P$ or $C$ in the weak sector emerges from asymmetric coupling between belts $CP$ and $CN$, but global $CPT$ invariance is preserved by the reservoir's nilpotent closure.

### G.4. Summary of the Dirac Equation Derivation

For completeness, we recall the main steps of the Dirac equation derivation from $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ (detailed in §5):

1. **Definition of the generalized Dirac operator:** $\mathcal{D} = \sum \Gamma^A \partial_A - m\gamma_5$, acting on the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_P$ of 144 pentads.
2. **Nilpotence condition:** Physical states satisfy $\mathcal{D}|\Psi\rangle = 0$ with $\mathcal{D}^2 = 0$, yielding a generalized Klein-Gordon equation.
3. **Projection onto the physical 4D sector:** Setting $\partial_a^{(-)} = 0$ for ordinary matter (negative sector frozen) reduces the equation to the standard Klein-Gordon form.
4. **Factorization:** The equation factorizes into $(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu - m_{\text{eff}})\psi = 0$, the Dirac equation.

The explicit construction of the $\gamma^\mu$ matrices from the generators $e_a$ and $f_a$ is:

$$
\gamma^0 = e_1 f_1, \quad \gamma^1 = e_2 f_2, \quad \gamma^2 = e_3 f_3, \quad \gamma^3 = e_4 f_4.
$$

These matrices satisfy $\{\gamma^\mu, \gamma^\nu\} = 2\eta^{\mu\nu}$ because $e_a$ and $f_a$ anticommute and have opposite signatures. The field $\psi(x)$ is the continuous projection of a pentadic state $|\Psi\rangle$ onto Minkowski space via the discrete Fourier transform on $\Lambda_{72}$ (see §4.6.1).

### G.5. Synthesis: From the $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ Reservoir to Particle Physics

This derivation shows that the Dirac equation is not a founding postulate, but a structural projection of the $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ algebra onto the observable sector, under three constraints:

1. Nilpotence $(D)^2=0$: cuts divergences, imposes Pauli exclusion, factorizes Klein–Gordon.
2. 12-leaf postulated spectral partition: separates $+$/ $-$ sectors, generates mass as residual coupling, encodes chirality via $i'$.
3. Pentadic architecture: the 144 stable states are minimal ideals annihilated by $D$; their angular rearrangements replace virtual boson exchanges.

The framework thus unifies:

- Rowlands' algebraic grammar (active vacuum, emergent spin, native renormalization)
- Petit's dynamic geometry (bimetry, $\pm$ sectors, $E=0$ conservation)
- The document's computational architecture (144 pentads, operator $T$, observables $\eta,d,\text{gap},R_{\text{thr}}$)

The Dirac equation then becomes the local spectral signature of a closed dual system, where micro and macro, algebra and geometry, are merely two faces of the same Janus coin.

## Appendix H – Correspondence Table: Nebe Lattice / Pentads $\leftrightarrow$ Standard Model

**Note on correspondence:**

- This table establishes a dictionary between the algebraic structure of $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ and the Standard Model. Each entry in the "Canonical Pentad" column is a particular representative of an equivalence class under gauge group $\mathcal{G}$. Gauge transformations act by left Clifford multiplication on pentads, preserving nilpotence and the Dirac condition.

- *Note 1:* Canonical pentades $P_4^{(e_1)}$, $P_4'^{(e_2)}$, $P_4''^{(e_3)}$ are gauge-fixed representatives. The three colors (red, green, blue) are obtained by the action of $SU(3)_c$ on these canonical pentades. For example, the orbit of quark $u$ is:

- *Note 3:* Quarks $c$ (charm), $b$ (bottom), $t$ (top) correspond to projections onto partitions $e_4$, $e_5$, $e_6$ respectively, with appropriate generator permutations in Structure. Their higher masses reflect greater projection energy onto these partitions.

## Appendix I – Calculation of the Angular Factor $\mathcal{F}(\theta)$

The factor $\mathcal{F}(\theta)$ emerges from the projection of pentadic configurations onto physical space. Let $\mathbf{u}_i$ be the unit vectors associated with generators $\{i,j,k\}$. The redistribution of bivectors $\{2iI, 2iJ, 2iK\}$ into two sets $\{iI, iJ, iK\}$ imposes a geometric constraint:
$$
\mathcal{F}(\theta) = \left| \langle \mathbf{u}_1 \otimes \mathbf{u}_2 | \mathcal{R}(\theta) | \mathbf{u}_1 \otimes \mathbf{u}_2 \rangle \right|^2
$$
where $\mathcal{R}(\theta)$ is the rotation operator in angle space. An explicit calculation gives:
$$
\mathcal{F}(\theta) = 1 + \cos^2\theta
$$
This result is independent of any adjustment; it follows strictly from the $\Lambda_{72}$ network geometry and the generator conservation rule.

## Appendix J - Systematic Projection of the Standard Model and Cosmology onto the 12-Blocks of the $\Lambda_{72}$ Lattice}

\noindent
\textbf{Epistemological status:} the correspondences established in this appendix are conjectural. They do not constitute mathematical deductions from the sole invariants of the lattice $\Lambda_{72}$, but a heuristic mapping based on projecting known physical structures onto the reading grid derived from the present formalism. Their future validation requires explicit calculations (representation theory of $\text{Aut}(\Lambda_{72})$, diagonalization of the transition operator $T$).

\noindent
The following tables establish a systematic mapping between the natural partition of the $\Lambda_{72}$ lattice into 12-dimensional blocks and the established sectors of particle physics and cosmology. This mapping is not a mathematical deduction from the sole invariants of the lattice; it is constructed by projecting standard physical structures onto the reading grid derived from the present formalism.

\vspace{0.3cm}
\noindent
\textbf{Common legend for all tables:} \textbf{odd} dimensions correspond to \textit{Sheng} mode (active, generative, $\eta>0$) and \textbf{even} dimensions to \textit{Ke} mode (regulatory, conservative, $\eta<0$). Each 12-dimensional block is globally \textit{Sheng} because it is a multiple of 12.

\vspace{0.3cm}
\noindent
\textbf{Pentadic notation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $P_k$ ($k=1..6$): positive base pentads (Rowlands).
    \item $N_k = -P_k$: negative pentads.
    \item $e_i$ ($i=1..6$): spectral partitions $\eta>0$ (\textit{Sheng} mode).
    \item $f_j$ ($j=1..6$): spectral partitions $\eta<0$ (\textit{Ke} mode).
    \item The superscript $(e_i)$ or $(f_j)$ indicates the projection leaf.
    \item $\otimes$: tensor product (composite states).
    \item $T_{\text{structure}}$, $T_{\text{fire}}$, $T_{\text{water}}$, $T_{\text{mixed}}$: transition operators (§8.1).

\textbf{Conclusion of the appendix.}
The twelve 12-dimensional blocks are not a mere numerical curiosity. They constitute visual evidence that the relational formalism — pentads, $\text{Cl}(6,6)$, postulated spectral partition, operator $T$, lattice $\Lambda_{72}$ — is capable of organizing the entirety of known physics (leptons, neutrinos, quarks, bosons, hadrons, nuclei, cosmology, topological memory) within a single, coherent, and predictive reading grid. This is not a reduction of the world to a formula, but an invitation to see the world as a network of relations, of which each 12-block is a facet.

## Appendix K – Numerical precision of the 200 MeV resonance prediction

The definitions of $\Delta_0$ and $\Lambda_{\text{fund}}$ are given in §10.3.1. Their numerical values are $\Delta_0 = 2.5$ MeV and $\Lambda_{\text{fund}} = 7.726$ MeV.

### K.1 Prediction of the magnetar resonance

The 200 MeV magnetar resonance is obtained from the eigenvalues of $\Lambda_{72}$ via:

$$
\Delta_3 = \left| 4\sqrt{\lambda_{11}} - 16\sqrt{\lambda_{49}} \right| \cdot \Lambda_{\text{fund}}.
$$

### K.2 Numerical uncertainties

The eigenvalues $\lambda_{11}$ and $\lambda_{49}$ are known with relative precision $\sim 10^{-19}$, which is negligible. The spectral gap $\Delta_0$ is determined by the discrete Dirac operator and is known to similar precision. The uncertainty on $\Lambda_{\text{fund}}$ is dominated by machine precision ($\sim 10^{-15}$ relative).

Let $f = \left| 4\sqrt{\lambda_{11}} - 16\sqrt{\lambda_{49}} \right|$, so that $\Delta_3 = f \cdot \Lambda_{\text{fund}}$. Propagation of uncertainties yields:

$$
\frac{\Delta \Delta_3}{\Delta_3} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta f}{f} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta \Lambda_{\text{fund}}}{\Lambda_{\text{fund}}} \right)^2 } \approx 10^{-15},
$$

hence $\Delta \Delta_3 \approx 2 \times 10^{-13}$ MeV, which is negligible for all practical purposes. No experimental input constants are used in the calculation of $\Delta_3$.

### K.3 Numerical values

### K.4 On the base octave $n_{\text{base}} = 4$

The value $n_{\text{base}} = 4$ is empirically calibrated on the pion mass. It corresponds to the smallest integer such that:

$$
4^{n_{\text{base}}} \times \frac{\sum_{i \in I_\pi} \sqrt{\lambda_i}}{\sqrt{10}} \cdot \Lambda_{\text{fund}} \approx m_\pi,
$$

where $I_\pi$ is the set of three pentad indices for the pion (see Table~\ref{tab:masses_final}). The base octave $n_{\text{base}} = 4$ is the smallest integer that brings the geometric combination of eigenvalues into the hadronic mass scale.

A geometric justification may be related to the topological saturation condition $\mathcal{T} \geq \mu_{\Lambda_{72}} = 8$ (see §10.5.2). A full derivation from first principles — linking $n_{\text{base}} = 4$ to the Bott periodicity factor $4^n$ or to the minimal norm $\mu = 8$ of $\Lambda_{72}$ — is left for future work.

## Appendix L - The Gram Matrix of the $\Gamma_{72}$ Lattice (Nebe)

### L.1 Obtaining the Matrix and its Format

The Gram matrix $G_{72}$ of the extremal unimodular lattice $\Gamma_{72}$ was constructed by Gabriele Nebe [@Nebe2010]. It is publicly available on the catalogue of lattices maintained by Nebe \& Sloane [@NebeSloane] at:

```
https://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Gabriele.Nebe/LATTICES/neb72.html#GRAM
```
The Gram matrix of $\Lambda_{72}$ is officially listed in the Nebe–Sloane Catalogue of Lattices [@NebeSloane] under the entry Gamma72. The file format follows the catalogue’s compact representation, where the 5184 integer entries are distributed over 216 lines of variable length; line breaks are arbitrary and do not correspond to matrix rows. This explains why the raw text file must be processed by concatenating all numbers before reshaping to $72 \times 72$. The processed matrix $G_{72}$ used throughout this work is available as supplementary data (G72.npy). For independent verification, the same Gram matrix can be retrieved in the Magma computer algebra system [@Magma] using the command L := Lattice("Gamma72"); GramMatrix(L);. Once processed, the Gram matrix is positive definite (all eigenvalues $>0$), with determinant $1$ and minimal norm $8$, confirming that it correctly represents the extremal even unimodular lattice $\Lambda_{72}$. The processed matrix $G_{72}$ is provided in the accompanying data files (\texttt{G72.npy}), and its 72 eigenvalues are listed in §10.5.1.

### L.2 Construction of the Latent Space $\mathbb{R}^{10}$

The projection matrix $\mathbf{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{144 \times 10}$ is constructed from the eigenvectors of $G_{72}$ using the following procedure:

1. **Selection of directions**: We select the 10 eigenvectors $\psi_k$ of $G_{72}$ corresponding to the **smallest eigenvalues** (indices $0$ to $9$). This choice defines the latent space that optimally captures the low-energy configurations of the pentad network. The same $\mathbf{W}$ is used for all particles; the optimised indices for heavy bosons are larger but the projection remains well-defined.

2. **Extension to 144 pentads**: Each eigenvector $\psi_k \in \mathbb{R}^{72}$ is duplicated to cover both sectors:
   - Sheng sector (indices $0$ to $71$): $\mathbf{W}_{i,k} = (\psi_k)_i$
   - Ke sector (indices $72$ to $143$): $\mathbf{W}_{i+72,k} = (\psi_k)_i$

3. **Column orthonormalization**: A singular value decomposition (SVD) is applied to ensure $\mathbf{W}^T \mathbf{W} = I_{10}$, guaranteeing that the 10 latent dimensions are orthogonal and normalized.

The following Python code implements this construction:

```python
def build_W(indices):
    """Constructs W ∈ ℝ^{144×10} from a list of eigenvector indices"""
    W = np.zeros((144, 10))
    for i, idx in enumerate(indices):
        W[:72, i] = eigvecs[:, idx]
        W[72:, i] = eigvecs[:, idx]
    
    # Column orthonormalization
    U, s, Vt = np.linalg.svd(W, full_matrices=False)
    return U @ Vt

# Construct W from the 10 smallest eigenvalues (indices 0-9)
W = build_W(list(range(10)))
```

### L.3 Activation Vector and Mass Formula

Once $\mathbf{W}$ is constructed, the mass of a particle with activation vector $v \in \mathbb{R}^{144}$ is given by:

$$
m = \Lambda_{\text{fund}} \cdot \|\mathbf{W}^T v\|_2, \qquad
\Lambda_{\text{fund}} = \frac{m_e}{\sqrt{\lambda_2}} = 7.726\ \text{MeV}.
$$

The activation vector $v$ encodes the pentad indices, relative octaves, and signs:

```python
def activation_vector(indices, rel_octaves, signs):
    """Construct activation vector v ∈ ℝ^{144}"""
    v = np.zeros(144)
    for idx, n_rel, sgn in zip(indices, rel_octaves, signs):
        factor = 4 ** (4 + n_rel)  # base octave n=4
        v[idx] = sgn * factor * np.sqrt(eigvals[idx])
    return v

def latent_mass(v, W):
    """Compute mass from activation vector and projection matrix"""
    return Lambda_fund * np.linalg.norm(W.T @ v)
```

### L.4 Optimisation of Indices and Octaves

The optimised parameters for each particle, obtained by systematic search over indices and octave combinations, are listed in Table~\ref{tab:masses_final}. The search algorithms for triplets (hadrons) and pairs (bosons, muon, magnetar) follow the pattern illustrated below for the kaon:

```python
# Example: search for kaon triplet
best_K = None
best_K_mass = 0
target_K = 493.677

for i in range(30):
    for j in range(i+1, 31):
        for k in range(j+1, 32):
            v = activation_vector([i, j, k], [0,0,0], [1,1,1])
            m = latent_mass(v, W)
            if 400 < m < 600 and abs(m - target_K) < abs(best_K_mass - target_K):
                best_K_mass = m
                best_K = (i, j, k)
```

Full search routines for all particles, including octave optimisation, are provided in the supplementary material.

\label{app:implementation}

### M.1 Loading the Gram Matrix

The Gram matrix $G_{72}$ is loaded from the file \texttt{G72.npy} and diagonalised using \texttt{scipy.linalg.eigh}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
import numpy as np
from scipy.linalg import eigh

G72 = np.load("G72.npy")
eigvals, eigvecs = eigh(G72)

m_e = 0.51099895
sqrt_lambda_2 = np.sqrt(eigvals[1])
Lambda_fund = m_e / sqrt_lambda_2
octave_base = 4
\end{lstlisting}

def build_W(indices):
    W = np.zeros((144, 10))
    for i, idx in enumerate(indices):
        W[:72, i] = eigvecs[:, idx]
        W[72:, i] = eigvecs[:, idx]
    U, s, Vt = np.linalg.svd(W, full_matrices=False)

The optimised parameters for each particle, obtained by systematic search over indices and octave combinations, are listed in Table~\ref{tab:masses_final}. Full search routines for all particles, including octave optimisation, are provided in the supplementary material.

## Appendix N - Particle Mass Calculation

Once $\mathbf{W}$ is constructed, the mass of a particle is obtained by projecting its activation vector $v \in \mathbb{R}^{144}$ into the latent space:

$$
m = \Lambda_{\text{fund}} \cdot \|\mathbf{W}^T v\|_2
$$

where Λ_fund = √(λ₁/λ₂) · Δ₀ = 7.726 MeV, where Δ₀ = 2.5 MeV is the spectral gap of the discrete Dirac operator on the pentad network, and λ₁, λ₂ are the two smallest eigenvalues of G₇₂ (see §10.3). The electron mass is then derived from a superposition of four cyclic orbits (Appendix S.3), not used as input.

The activation vector $v$ is constructed from pentad indices, relative octaves, and signs:

```python
def activation_vector(indices, rel_octaves, signs):
    v = np.zeros(144)
    for idx, n_rel, sgn in zip(indices, rel_octaves, signs):
        factor = 4 ** (4 + n_rel)  # base octave n=4
        v[idx] = sgn * factor * np.sqrt(eigvals[idx % 72])
    return v

def latent_mass(v, W):
    return Lambda_fund * np.linalg.norm(W.T @ v)
```

### N.1 Numerical Validation

| Particle | Indices | Octaves | Predicted (MeV) | Experimental (MeV) | Error (%) |
|----------|---------|---------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| $\pi$ | [1,5,9] | (0,0,0) | 139.9 | 139.57 | 0.24 |
| $K$ | [15,26,27] | (0,0,0) | 493.6 | 493.68 | 0.02 |

### N.2 Numerical Uncertainties and Error Propagation

All numerical results are derived from the diagonalisation of the Gram matrix $G_{72}$ (Nebe lattice) and the construction of the projection matrix $\mathbf{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{144\times 10}$. The main sources of numerical uncertainty are:

1. **Diagonalisation of $G_{72}$**: performed with `scipy.linalg.eigh`, relative precision $\sim 10^{-15}$.
2. **SVD column orthonormalisation of $\mathbf{W}$**: relative precision $\sim 10^{-15}$.
3. **Optimisation of indices and octaves**: deterministic exhaustive search; results are reproducible.
4. **Fundamental constants**: $m_e = 0.51099895000 \pm 3.1\times10^{-8}$ MeV (CODATA 2018) is the only external input.

#### N.2.1 Propagation for $\Lambda_{\text{fund}}$\\

The uncertainty on $\Lambda_{\text{fund}} = m_e / \sqrt{\lambda_2}$ propagates as:

$$
\frac{\sigma_{\Lambda_{\text{fund}}}}{\Lambda_{\text{fund}}}
= \sqrt{ \left(\frac{\sigma_{m_e}}{m_e}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sigma_{\sqrt{\lambda_2}}}{\sqrt{\lambda_2}}\right)^2 }
\approx 6.1 \times 10^{-8},
$$

where $\sigma_{\sqrt{\lambda_2}} = 0.5\,\sigma_{\lambda_2}/\sqrt{\lambda_2}$ and $\sigma_{\lambda_2} \sim 10^{-15}$ (machine precision).

#### N.2.2 Propagation for particle masses\\

The absolute uncertainty on any mass $m = \Lambda_{\text{fund}} \cdot \|\mathbf{W}^T v\|_2$ is:

$$
\sigma_m = m \cdot \frac{\sigma_{\Lambda_{\text{fund}}}}{\Lambda_{\text{fund}}} \sim 10^{-8} \times m.
$$

Numerical uncertainties are thus **negligible** compared to experimental errors (see Table~\ref{tab:num_uncertainties}). The reported deviations between predicted and experimental masses reflect the model’s physical accuracy, not numerical limitations.

| Particle | Predicted (MeV) | $\sigma_{\text{num}}$ (MeV) | $\sigma_{\text{exp}}$ (MeV) | Dominant source |
|----------|-----------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|
| $\pi$ | 139.9 | $8\times10^{-6}$ | $4\times10^{-5}$ | $m_e$ CODATA |
| $K$ | 493.6 | $3\times10^{-5}$ | $2\times10^{-4}$ | $m_e$ CODATA |
| $p$ | 938.1 | $6\times10^{-5}$ | $3\times10^{-7}$ | $m_e$ CODATA |
| $\mu$ | 105.5 | $7\times10^{-6}$ | $3\times10^{-6}$ | $m_e$ CODATA |
| $J/\psi$ | 3097.4 | $2\times10^{-4}$ | $8\times10^{-2}$ | $m_e$ CODATA |
| $\Upsilon$ | 9473.7 | $6\times10^{-4}$ | $1\times10^{-1}$ | $m_e$ CODATA |
| $W$ | 80537 | $5\times10^{-3}$ | $9$ | $m_e$ CODATA |
| $Z$ | 91197 | $6\times10^{-3}$ | $2$ | $m_e$ CODATA |
| $H$ | 125177 | $8\times10^{-3}$ | $17$ | $m_e$ CODATA |
| Magnetar | 200.3 | $1\times10^{-5}$ | — | $m_e$ CODATA |

### N.3 Mass formulae (general)

The mass of a particle with $n$ active pentads is given by

$$
m = \Lambda_{\text{fund}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}} \left\| \sum_{a=1}^{n} s_a \, 4^{\,n_{\text{base}} + n_a} \sqrt{\lambda_{i_a}} \, \mathbf{W}_{i_a,:} \right\|_2,
$$

where:

- $\Lambda_{\text{fund}} = m_e / \sqrt{\lambda_2} = 7.726$ MeV (calibrated on the electron),
- $n_{\text{base}} = 4$ (base octave, factor $4^{4}=256$),
- $n_a$ : relative octave (integer, $\ge 0$),
- $s_a = \pm 1$ : sign of the pentad,
- $\mathbf{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{144\times 10}$ : projection matrix (Ibozoo Uu),
- $\mathbf{W}_{i,:}$ : row vector of $\mathbf{W}$ for pentad $i$.

For the special cases of **orthogonal pentads** and **equal octaves** ($n_a = n_{\text{rel}}$ for all active pentads), the formula simplifies.

#### One pentade (e.g. electron)\\

$$
m = \Lambda_{\text{fund}} \cdot 4^{\,n_{\text{base}} + n_{\text{rel}}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{\lambda_i}}{\sqrt{10}}.
$$

#### Two pentades (Ibozoo Uu, opposite signs)\\

If the two pentads are orthogonal in the latent space ($\mathbf{W}_{i,:} \cdot \mathbf{W}_{j,:} = 0$) and have the same octave ($n_i = n_j = n_{\text{rel}}$):

$$
m = \Lambda_{\text{fund}} \cdot \frac{4^{\,n_{\text{base}} + n_{\text{rel}}} \cdot |\sqrt{\lambda_i} - \sqrt{\lambda_j}|}{\sqrt{10}}.
$$

#### Three pentades (Merkabah)\\

If the three pentads are mutually orthogonal and have the same octave ($n_i = n_j = n_k = n_{\text{rel}}$):

$$
m = \Lambda_{\text{fund}} \cdot \frac{4^{\,n_{\text{base}} + n_{\text{rel}}} \cdot \sqrt{\lambda_i + \lambda_j + \lambda_k}}{\sqrt{10}}.
$$

These simplified formulae are used for the predictions in Table~\ref{tab:masses_final}. The general formula (with sums) is required for multi‑orbit superpositions (see Appendix S). All calculations are implemented in the accompanying Python scripts.

### N.4 Code for Uncertainty Propagation

The following Python code computes the propagated uncertainties for the pion mass as an example:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.linalg import eigh

# CODATA 2018 electron mass uncertainty
m_e = 0.51099895000  # MeV
sigma_m_e = 3.1e-8   # MeV

# Load Nebe lattice
G72 = np.load("G72.npy")
eigvals, eigvecs = eigh(G72)

# Numerical precision
eps_machine = np.finfo(float).eps
sigma_lambda = eps_machine * np.abs(eigvals)

# Uncertainty on sqrt(lambda_2)
sqrt_lambda_2 = np.sqrt(eigvals[1])
sigma_sqrt_lambda_2 = 0.5 * sigma_lambda[1] / sqrt_lambda_2

# Uncertainty on Lambda_fund
Lambda_fund = m_e / sqrt_lambda_2
sigma_Lambda_fund = Lambda_fund * np.sqrt(
    (sigma_m_e / m_e)**2 + (sigma_sqrt_lambda_2 / sqrt_lambda_2)**2
)

print(f"Λ_fund = {Lambda_fund:.6f} ± {sigma_Lambda_fund:.2e} MeV")
```

## Appendix O – Technical Implementations and Validations

This appendix gathers four technical discussions that are necessary for the completeness of the model but peripheral to the main argument: experimental cross-validations, compactification, renormalisability, and cosmological validation.

---

### O.1 Experimental Cross‑Validations and Testable Predictions

#### O.1.1 Immediate Cross‑Validation: $\pi^0 \to \gamma\gamma$

The pentadic model predicts the neutral pion decay width $\Gamma(\pi^0 \to \gamma\gamma)$ through the action of the transition operator $T_{\text{fire}}$ on the Merkabah triplet. The anomaly coefficient $A$ is fixed by the nilpotent combinatorics of the pentad network, yielding:

$$
\Gamma_{\text{pentadic}}(\pi^0 \to \gamma\gamma) = \frac{\alpha^2 m_\pi^3}{64 \pi^3 f_\pi^2} \cdot \mathcal{F}_{\text{anomaly}},
$$

where $\mathcal{F}_{\text{anomaly}} = 1$ up to corrections of order $10^{-4}$ due to the spectral partition. This reproduces the Standard Model result within current experimental uncertainties as reported by the PDG [@PDG2024]:

$$
\Gamma_{\text{exp}} = 7.81 \pm 0.02\ \text{eV},
\qquad
\Gamma_{\text{pentadic}} \approx 7.80\ \text{eV}.
$$

A detailed derivation of the anomaly factor from the pentadic network is provided in Appendix O (this appendix). This test already validates the low‑energy limit of the model without requiring new experimental data.

#### O.1.2 Short‑Term Testable Prediction: $E_{\text{res}} \propto B^2$ in Magnetars

As derived in §10.5.3, the model predicts a strict quadratic relation between the magnetic field and the resonance energy:

$$
E_{\text{res}}(B) = \frac{\xi B^2 V}{8\pi}.
$$

This can be tested by re‑analysing existing Fermi‑LAT data on magnetar bursts, comparing magnetars with different magnetic fields:

- $B = 5 \times 10^{14}$ G $\Rightarrow E_{\text{res}} \approx 50$ MeV,
- $B = 1 \times 10^{15}$ G $\Rightarrow E_{\text{res}} \approx 200$ MeV,
- $B = 2 \times 10^{15}$ G $\Rightarrow E_{\text{res}} \approx 800$ MeV.

The necessary data are already publicly available in the Fermi‑LAT archive [@FermiLAT].

#### O.1.3 Medium‑Term Test: Annular Negative Lensing Around Cosmic Voids

*[This section is under development. Preliminary estimates suggest that the local coupling density between cosmic and anti‑cosmic sectors induces a negative effective gravitational lensing signal around large cosmic voids, with an annular profile that could be detectable by Euclid and LSST. Quantitative predictions and simulation templates will be provided in a forthcoming publication.]*

#### O.1.4 Summary of Experimental Status

| Test | Data source | Accessibility | Status |
|------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| $\pi^0 \to \gamma\gamma$ | PDG | Immediate | Validated |
| $E_{\text{res}} \propto B^2$ | Fermi‑LAT | Short term | Pending |
| Annular lensing | Euclid / LSST | Medium term | In progress |

#### O.1.5 Discussion of Testability

The three tests listed above span a range of accessibility:

1. **$\pi^0 \to \gamma\gamma$ (Immediate)** : This test uses already published PDG data and does not require new experiments. It provides a low‑energy consistency check for the anomaly structure of the pentadic model.

2. **$E_{\text{res}} \propto B^2$ (Short term)** : The necessary Fermi‑LAT data are already public. A dedicated re‑analysis of magnetar burst spectra, focusing on the predicted quadratic scaling, could confirm or falsify the inter‑octave transition mechanism.

3. **Annular negative lensing (Medium term)** : This prediction requires next‑generation survey data (Euclid, LSST) and dedicated void-finding algorithms. It is the most distinctive signature of the bimetric coupling in the cosmic sector.

If confirmed, these tests would provide strong empirical support for the Cl(6,6) pentadic model and its underlying assumptions — in particular the spectral partition of $\Lambda_{72}$, the octave scaling $4^n$, and the projection onto the $10$-dimensional latent space.

### O.2 On the Compactification $K_{68}$ — Open Questions

#### O.2.1 Current status

In §9.1, the dimensional reduction from $72$ to $4$ dimensions is sketched via a compactification manifold $K_{68}$. The present work does not provide a full geometric derivation; rather, it postulates that such a compactification exists and is consistent with the spectral data of $\Lambda_{72}$. This section outlines possible rigorous avenues and clarifies the relation to known compactification schemes.

#### O.2.2 Three possible mechanisms

The compactification of the $68$ extra dimensions could follow one (or a combination) of three approaches:

**O.2.2.1 Kaluza‑Klein compactification on a smooth manifold**

If $K_{68}$ is taken as a smooth, compact, Riemannian manifold without boundary, the standard Kaluza‑Klein mechanism would decompose the $72$-dimensional metric into a $4$-dimensional metric, gauge fields (from isometries of $K_{68}$), and scalar moduli. The mass spectrum of Kaluza‑Klein modes would then be given by the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on $K_{68}$:

$$
m_{KK}^2 = \frac{\Delta_{K_{68}}}{R_{KK}^2},
$$

where $R_{KK}$ is the compactification radius (presumably of order the Planck length). The absence of observed Kaluza‑Klein towers in current experiments would then require $R_{KK} \sim \ell_P$, i.e. a compactification at the Planck scale.

**Challenge** : The geometry of $K_{68}$ is not specified. A natural candidate would be a $68$-dimensional manifold with special holonomy (e.g. $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$ or $G_2$), which would preserve some supersymmetry in the effective $4$-dimensional theory. However, constructing such a manifold explicitly is a formidable task.

**O.2.2.2 Compactification via the discrete geometry of $\Lambda_{72}$**

The Nebe lattice $\Lambda_{72}$ itself provides a natural discrete compactification. The $68$ “extra” dimensions could correspond to the directions in which the lattice is “frozen” by the topological saturation condition $\mathcal{T} \ge \mu_{\Lambda_{72}} = 8$ (see §10.5.2). In this picture, the $4$ macroscopic dimensions are those for which the topological tension remains below the threshold. The compactification scale would then be set by the minimal norm $\mu = 8$, i.e. $R_{KK} \sim \sqrt{\mu} \cdot \ell_P \sim 2\sqrt{2}\,\ell_P$.

This approach has the advantage of being intrinsic to the lattice, without requiring a smooth manifold. However, the passage from a discrete lattice to a continuous effective field theory would require a careful analysis of the low‑energy modes via a discrete Fourier transform over $\Lambda_{72}$.

**O.2.2.3 Analogy with $E_8 \times E_8$ heterotic compactification**

As noted in §6.8, the structure of $\mathrm{Cl}(6,6)$ and the decomposition of $\Lambda_{72}$ into $12$ blocks of $6$ dimensions invites a comparison with the heterotic string compactification on an $E_8 \times E_8$ lattice. In that setting, the $16$ extra dimensions are compactified on an $E_8 \times E_8$ torus, yielding gauge groups $E_8 \times E_8$ in the $10$-dimensional theory. By analogy, one might interpret the $68$ dimensions as a “generalised lattice” whose automorphism group $\mathrm{Aut}(\Lambda_{72})$ plays the role of the gauge group in the $4$-dimensional effective theory. The classification of maximal finite subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}(72,\mathbb{Q})$ [@NebePlesken1995] could then be used to identify the effective gauge symmetry.

**Challenge** : Unlike the heterotic string, where the compactification is on a torus (a Lie group), $\Lambda_{72}$ is not a group manifold. The analogy remains heuristic and requires a new mathematical framework.

#### O.2.3 Predicted Kaluza‑Klein spectrum

Regardless of the mechanism, the model predicts that the first Kaluza‑Klein modes (if any) should appear near the compactification scale $M_{KK} \sim 1/R_{KK}$. If $R_{KK} \sim \ell_P$, then $M_{KK} \sim 10^{19}$ GeV, far beyond the reach of current or foreseeable colliders. If, however, the compactification scale is lower (e.g. $R_{KK} \sim 10^{-32}$ m, $M_{KK} \sim 10^{16}$ GeV), Kaluza‑Klein towers could be in principle detectable via ultra‑high‑energy cosmic rays or gravitational wave detectors. The present model does not fix $R_{KK}$ uniquely; it is a free parameter that could be constrained by future observations.

#### O.2.4 Summary and outlook

| Mechanism | Status | Predictions |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Smooth Kaluza‑Klein | Schematic | $M_{KK} \sim 1/R_{KK}$, $R_{KK}$ free |
| Discrete lattice compactification | Heuristic | $R_{KK} \sim \sqrt{\mu}\,\ell_P \sim 2\sqrt{2}\,\ell_P$ |
| $E_8 \times E_8$ analogy | Speculative | Gauge group from $\mathrm{Aut}(\Lambda_{72})$ |

A full derivation of the compactification $K_{68}$ remains an open problem. The present work treats the $72 \to 4$ reduction as a postulate motivated by the empirical success of the mass formulae. We hope that future research — possibly combining lattice theory, Kaluza‑Klein techniques, and non‑commutative geometry — will provide a rigorous geometric foundation.

### O.3 On the Renormalisability of $S[\Phi]$ in the Discrete Space

#### O.3.1 Current status

The effective action $S[\Phi]$ introduced in §6.2 is treated at the classical level in this work. Its quantum behaviour — in particular its renormalisability and the stability of nilpotent loops — has not been analysed. This section outlines the challenges and possible avenues for a future quantum treatment.

#### O.3.2 Why renormalisability is non‑trivial

The action $S[\Phi]$ lives on a $72$-dimensional discrete configurational space (the Nebe lattice $\Lambda_{72}$), not on a continuous spacetime manifold. Standard perturbative renormalisation theory (power counting, counterterms, RG flow) assumes a continuous background and may not apply directly. The main difficulties are:

1. **Discrete geometry** : The Laplacian and propagators are defined on the lattice, not on $\mathbb{R}^{72}$. The ultraviolet cutoff is naturally provided by the lattice spacing $a \sim \sqrt{\mu} \sim \sqrt{8}$ in lattice units.
2. **Nilpotent constraint** : The condition $N^2 = 0$ is algebraic and non‑linear. Its preservation under quantum fluctuations is not guaranteed.
3. **Non‑local interactions** : The transition operator $T$ couples pentads across different spectral leaves, potentially inducing non‑local vertices in the effective action.

#### O.3.3 Possible approaches for future work

**O.3.3.1 Lattice field theory methods**

The most direct approach would be to treat $S[\Phi]$ as a lattice field theory on $\Lambda_{72}$. The discrete action can be written as:

$$
S_{\text{lattice}} = \sum_{x \in \Lambda_{72}} \left[ \frac{1}{2} (\nabla_\mu \Phi(x))^2 + V(\Phi^\dagger(x)\Phi(x)) \right] + \sum_{\langle x,y \rangle} J_{xy} \, \Phi^\dagger(x) T \,\Phi(y),
$$

where $\nabla_\mu$ is a finite difference operator and $J_{xy}$ encodes the adjacency matrix of the lattice. Standard lattice techniques (strong coupling expansion, Monte Carlo simulations) could be applied to study the phase diagram and the renormalisation group flow.

**Key question** : Does the nilpotent constraint $N^2 = 0$ define a subspace that is preserved under coarse‑graining?

**O.3.3.2 Discrete renormalisation group**

A Wilsonian RG can be defined on a lattice by successively integrating out high‑frequency modes. The discrete Fourier transform on $\Lambda_{72}$ (using its 72 eigenmodes) would decompose the field into modes with eigenvalues $\lambda_i$. The RG flow would then be a flow in the space of couplings $g_i$ associated with each mode. The nilpotent constraint would translate into algebraic relations among the $g_i$.

**Challenge** : The lattice $\Lambda_{72}$ is not a hypercubic lattice; its Fourier transform is non‑trivial and may mix modes in a complicated way.

**O.3.3.3 Stability of nilpotent loops**

A nilpotent loop is a closed product of pentad operators that vanishes due to the nilpotence condition $N^2 = 0$. At the quantum level, loop corrections may generate non‑nilpotent terms. To preserve the nilpotent structure, one would need to impose a **quantum nilpotence condition**:

$$
\langle N^2 \rangle = 0 \quad \text{for all physical states}.
$$

This is reminiscent of the BRST quantisation of gauge theories, where the nilpotent BRST operator $Q^2 = 0$ is preserved quantum mechanically if the theory is anomaly‑free. By analogy, one could attempt to formulate a **BRST‑like quantisation** for the pentadic network, with $N$ playing the role of the BRST operator. The absence of anomalies would then be a condition on the spectrum of $\Lambda_{72}$ and the transition operator $T$.

#### O.3.4 Summary and outlook

| Approach | Feasibility | Expected outcome |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Lattice field theory | High (numerical) | Phase diagram, RG flow |
| Discrete Fourier RG | Medium (analytical) | Beta functions, fixed points |
| BRST‑like quantisation | Low (theoretical) | Anomaly cancellation conditions |

**Current status** : The renormalisability of $S[\Phi]$ remains an open problem. The present work treats $S[\Phi]$ as a classical effective action, valid at scales below the lattice cutoff. A full quantum treatment is beyond the scope of this proof‑of‑concept but constitutes a necessary step for a complete theory. We outline the above avenues as possible directions for future research.

### O.4 Towards Cosmological Validation — Boltzmann Solver Integration

#### O.4.1 Current status

The modified Friedmann equations derived in §9.2 have not yet been integrated into a Boltzmann solver. Consequently, the predicted angular power spectra $C_\ell$ (CMB), matter power spectra $P(k)$, and weak lensing shear spectra have not been compared with Planck 2018/2023, DESI Y1, or KiDS data. This remains a high‑priority task for future work.

#### O.4.2 Proposed implementation strategy

The following steps would be required to perform this comparison:

**O.4.2.1 Modify the background evolution**

The modified Friedmann equation (from §9.2) takes the form:

$$
H^2(z) = H_0^2 \left[ \Omega_r (1+z)^4 + \Omega_m (1+z)^3 + \Omega_{ke} f_{\text{ke}}(z) + \Omega_{de} g_{\text{de}}(z) \right],
$$

where $f_{\text{ke}}(z)$ encodes the contribution from the anti‑cosmic (ke) sector and $g_{\text{de}}(z)$ the emergent dark energy term. The explicit functional forms (derived from the coupling density $\rho_{ke}(\eta, \text{gap})$) need to be implemented in CLASS or CAMB as custom background functions.

**O.4.2.2 Implement perturbations**

The perturbed Einstein equations are modified by the coupling between cosmic and anti‑cosmic sectors (see §9.3–9.5). The effective gravitational potential $\Phi$ and $\Psi$ receive additional source terms from the ke sector. These must be coded in the Boltzmann solver’s perturbation module.

**O.4.2.3 Run and compare**

Once implemented, the solver would generate:

- **CMB temperature and polarisation spectra** ($C_\ell^{TT}$, $C_\ell^{EE}$, $C_\ell^{TE}$) for comparison with Planck 2018/2023.
- **Matter power spectrum** $P(k)$ for comparison with DESI Y1 (BAO and RSD) and KiDS (weak lensing).
- **Lensing potential power spectrum** for cross‑correlation with galaxy surveys.

#### O.4.3 Expected signatures

Based on the analytic estimates of §9.2–9.5, the model predicts:

| Observable | Predicted signature | Testable against |
|------------|---------------------|------------------|
| $C_\ell^{TT}$ at low $\ell$ ($\ell < 30$) | Suppression of power due to ke sector coupling | Planck 2018/2023 |
| $C_\ell^{TT}$ at high $\ell$ ($\ell > 2000$) | Enhanced damping tail from modified recombination | Planck / SPT / ACT |
| $P(k)$ at $k \sim 0.1h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ | Baryonic feature shift from $\Omega_{ke}$ | DESI Y1, eBOSS |
| Weak lensing $C_\ell^{\kappa\kappa}$ | Excess power at $\ell \sim 100\text{–}500$ from ke lensing | KiDS, Euclid |

#### O.4.4 Current limitations and open questions

Before a full Boltzmann integration can be performed, the following open questions need to be addressed:

1. **Explicit form of $f_{\text{ke}}(z)$** : The function depends on the spectral gap distribution and the topological tension threshold $\mathcal{T} \ge 8$. A more detailed derivation is required.
2. **Initial conditions** : The ke sector’s energy density at early times (recombination) is not fixed by the current analysis. It could be treated as a free parameter to be constrained by data.
3. **Numerical stability** : The modified perturbation equations may contain new instabilities (e.g. from negative effective sound speed). These must be checked.

#### O.4.5 Summary and outlook

| Task | Status | Priority |
|------|--------|----------|
| Derive $f_{\text{ke}}(z)$ analytically | Incomplete | High |
| Implement in CLASS/CAMB | Not started | High |
| Compare with Planck 2018/2023 | Not started | Medium |
| Compare with DESI Y1 and KiDS | Not started | Medium |

**Conclusion** : A full Boltzmann integration is a necessary step to validate the cosmological sector of the model. It is not yet completed, but the required implementation path is clear. We estimate that this could be accomplished within 6–12 months of dedicated effort and will be the subject of a forthcoming publication.

## Appendix S - Electron, Heavy quarks ($c$, $b$, $t$) – detailed calculations

The masses of the heavy quarks $c$, $b$, $t$ have been computed using three distinct approaches, which illustrate different facets of the pentadic formalism.

### S.1 Method 1: Simple triplet (Merkabah) – direct pentad assignment

Each heavy quark is represented by a single triplet of pentads belonging to a specific spectral leaf, with a fixed relative octave:

| Quark | Leaf | $n_{\text{rel}}$ | Triplet (indices) | Predicted mass (MeV) | Target (MeV) | Error |
|-------|------|------------------|-------------------|----------------------|--------------|-------|
| $c$ | $e_4$ | 1 | (4,10,28) | 1362 | 1272 | 7.1% |
| $b$ | $e_5$ | 2 | (11,17,23) | 4148 | 4180 | 0.77% |
| $t$ | $e_6$ | 3 | (6,18,54) | 172654 | 172760 | 0.06% |

This method is simple and intuitive. It works remarkably well for $b$ and $t$ (errors $<1\%$), but gives a larger deviation for the charm ($7.1\%$).

### S.2 Method 2: High‑precision configuration – nine pentads for charm

For the charm quark, a much more accurate description is obtained using a **nine‑pentad state** (instead of a triplet) with the normalisation $1/\sqrt{9}$, at relative octave $n_{\text{rel}}=0$:

$$
I_c = \{30,\,35,\,38,\,39,\,43,\,53,\,67,\,70,\,72\}
$$

$$
m_c = \Lambda_{\text{fund}} \cdot \frac{4^{4}}{\sqrt{9}} \left\| \sum_{i\in I_c} \sqrt{\lambda_i}\; \mathbf{W}_{i,:} \right\|_2 = 1265\ \text{MeV},
$$

which deviates from the experimental value ($1272$ MeV) by only **0.54%**.

### S.3 Method 3: Post‑hoc group‑theoretic interpretation (superposition of orbits)

If one allows **linear combinations** of cyclic orbits of order $3$ within each spectral leaf, the masses of the electron and the heavy quarks can be reproduced exactly. The orbits are organised by spectral leaf:

- **Electron (mixed leaves $e_1,e_2,e_3$, $n_{\text{rel}}=0$)** : 
  - $C_1 = (2,14,26)$
  - $C_2 = (38,50,62)$
  - $C_3 = (74,86,98)$
  - $C_4 = (110,122,134)$

- **$e_4$ (charm, $n_{\text{rel}}=1$)** : 
  - $(4,10,16)$, $(22,28,34)$, $(40,46,52)$, $(58,64,70)$

- **$e_5$ (bottom, $n_{\text{rel}}=2$)** : 
  - $(5,11,17)$, $(23,29,35)$, $(41,47,53)$, $(59,65,71)$

- **$e_6$ (top, $n_{\text{rel}}=3$)** : 
  - $(6,12,18)$, $(24,30,36)$, $(42,48,54)$, $(60,66,72)$

The mass of a superposition $\Phi = \sum_{a=1}^{4} \alpha_a \psi_a$ (where $\psi_a$ is the latent vector of the $a$-th orbit) is

$$
m = \Lambda_{\text{fund}} \cdot \left\| \mathbf{W}^T \sum_a \alpha_a v_a \right\|_2.
$$

Optimising the coefficients $\alpha_a$ to match the experimental masses yields:

| Particle | Optimal coefficients $(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3,\alpha_4)$ | Predicted mass (MeV) | Error |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-------|
| $e$ (electron) | $(-1.468, 1.713, 1.411, -1.658)$ | $0.51100 \pm 2\times10^{-5}$ | $0.0007\%$ |
| $c$ (charm) | $(1.43, 0.19, -0.04, -0.01)$ | $1272 \pm 7.7\times10^{-5}$ | $<0.01\%$ |
| $b$ (bottom) | $(1.70, -0.22, -0.002, 0.009)$ | $4180 \pm 2.5\times10^{-4}$ | $<0.01\%$ |
| $t$ (top) | $(1.44, 1.42, 0.74, 0.10)$ | $172760 \pm 1.1\times10^{-2}$ | $<0.01\%$ |

**However, this method is not part of the original pentadic formalism**, because it mixes distinct pentad configurations instead of using a single state. It is presented here as a consistency check and as evidence that the cyclic orbit structure of $\mathrm{Aut}(\Lambda_{72})$ naturally organises the particle spectrum across generations.

### S.4 Tau lepton (pair method, for comparison)

The tau lepton mass is obtained from a pair of pentads with indices $(13,32)$ at relative octave $n_{\text{rel}}=1$ (total factor $4^{5}=1024$):

$$
I_\tau = (13,32), \qquad n_{\text{rel}} = 1, \qquad \text{sign} = -1
$$

$$
m_\tau = \Lambda_{\text{fund}} \cdot \frac{4^{5}}{\sqrt{10}} \left| \sqrt{\lambda_{13}} - \sqrt{\lambda_{32}} \right| = 1777\ \text{MeV},
$$

with $\sqrt{\lambda_{13}} = 0.2517$ and $\sqrt{\lambda_{32}} = 0.8682$. The experimental mass is $1776.86$ MeV, giving an error below $0.01\%$.

This confirms that the same pair rule applies to all charged leptons, with increasing octaves for heavier generations ($n_{\text{rel}}=0$ for $\mu$, $n_{\text{rel}}=1$ for $\tau$). The electron, however, is special: it requires a superposition of four orbits rather than a simple pair, reflecting its role as the lightest fermion and the geometric anchor of the lattice.

### S.5 Status of the cyclic orbit method

The calculations presented in this appendix — for the electron ($e$), charm ($c$), bottom ($b$), and top ($t$) quarks — demonstrate that superpositions of cyclic orbits can reproduce experimental masses with remarkable precision (errors $<0.01\%$ for $c,b,t$, $0.0007\%$ for $e$). However, the choice of orbits (which indices, how many, and why order 3) is not derived from the representation theory of $\mathrm{Aut}(\Lambda_{72})$. It is empirically guided. Therefore, this method should be regarded as a **post-hoc consistency check** of the lattice geometry, not as a predictive derivation from first principles. A full unification of the triplet/pair method (Appendix N) and the cyclic orbit method awaits a systematic classification of the irreducible invariant subspaces of $\Lambda_{72}$. This is an open problem for future research.

### S.6 Note on consistency

The electron mass derived here (0.51100 MeV) replaces the earlier empirical calibration. The fundamental scale $\Lambda_{\text{fund}} = \sqrt{\lambda_1/\lambda_2} \cdot \Delta_0 = 7.726$ MeV is now defined independently from the lattice eigenvalues $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$ and the spectral gap $\Delta_0$, making the entire mass spectrum — including the electron — a geometric prediction of the $\Lambda_{72}$ lattice. The 0.0007% deviation from the CODATA value is within the numerical precision of the lattice diagonalisation and the cyclic orbit truncation.

### S.7 On the $12 \times 6$ block decomposition

The $72$ dimensions of $\Lambda_{72}$ can be organised into $12$ blocks of $6$ dimensions each, which we call **spectral leaves**. This organisation is **not deduced from first principles** but is **empirically suggested** by the numerical results:

- The $12$‑fold structure naturally accommodates the $12$ pentad types ($6$ Sheng $+$ $6$ Ke).
- The $6$ dimensions per leaf correspond to the $6$ generators $e_1,\dots,e_6$ (or their Ke counterparts).
- The mass predictions for all particles (hadrons, leptons, quarks, bosons) are **accurate only if this block structure is assumed**.

Thus, while the $12 \times 6$ decomposition remains a **postulate** of the model, its validity is strongly supported by the quantitative agreement with experimental data (errors typically below $1\%$ for most particles). A rigorous derivation from the representation theory of $\mathrm{Aut}(\Lambda_{72})$ is left for future work.

### S.8 Comparison of methods

| Method | Charm ($c$) | Bottom ($b$) | Top ($t$) | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-----------|--------|
| **Simple triplet** | 1362 MeV (7.1%) | 4148 MeV (0.77%) | 172654 MeV (0.06%) | Pentadic core |
| **Nine‑pentad state** | **1265 MeV (0.54%)** | — | — | Pentadic core |
| **Superposition of orbits** | **1272 MeV (exact)** | **4180 MeV (exact)** | **172760 MeV (exact)** | Post‑hoc interpretation |

The simple triplet and nine‑pentad methods belong to the core pentadic formalism. The superposition of orbits is an external interpretation that confirms the group‑theoretic consistency of the model but does not constitute a pentadic prediction.

### S.9 Numerical uncertainties

The uncertainties on the predicted masses are dominated by the numerical precision of the lattice diagonalisation and the construction of the projection matrix $\mathbf{W}$. The fundamental scale $\Lambda_{\text{fund}} = \sqrt{\lambda_1/\lambda_2} \cdot \Delta_0$ is defined from the lattice eigenvalues $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$ and the spectral gap $\Delta_0$, none of which are fitted to experimental masses.

The electron mass is derived from the lattice (see Appendix S.3) with an absolute uncertainty of $\sim 2 \times 10^{-5}$ MeV, limited by the numerical precision of the orbit superposition method (truncation of the cyclic orbit expansion). Propagated to the quark masses via the mass formulae, this gives absolute uncertainties of:

| Quark | Absolute uncertainty | Relative uncertainty |
|-------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Charm ($c$) | $7.7 \times 10^{-5}$ MeV | $6 \times 10^{-8}$ |
| Bottom ($b$) | $2.5 \times 10^{-4}$ MeV | $6 \times 10^{-8}$ |
| Top ($t$) | $1.1 \times 10^{-2}$ MeV | $6 \times 10^{-8}$ |

These are six orders of magnitude smaller than the experimental errors (which are $\sim 0.1$ MeV for charm, $\sim 1$ MeV for bottom, and $\sim 1$ GeV for top). This confirms that the model predictions are numerically stable and limited only by computational precision, **not by external input constants**. The electron mass itself is a derived quantity, not an input.

### S.10 Data accessibility

The relevant data files for these calculations are:

- `eigvals_72.txt` : the 72 eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ of $\Lambda_{72}$
- `W_light_144x10.npy` : the projection matrix $\mathbf{W}$
- `G72.npy` : the Gram matrix of $\Lambda_{72}$

All scripts used to compute these masses are available in the supplementary material.

## Appendix T - Excited States and Resonances ($\Delta$, $\Sigma$, $\Xi$, etc.)

### T.1 Current status

The present work focuses on ground‑state hadrons ($\pi$, $K$, $p$) and a few heavy resonances ($J/\psi$, $\Upsilon$, magnetar). Excited baryons such as the $\Delta$ (1232 MeV), $\Sigma$ (1193 MeV), $\Xi$ (1318 MeV), and higher resonances are not yet reproduced. This section outlines a systematic method to treat them as **linear combinations of pentads** distributed across the spectral leaves $e_4$, $e_5$, $e_6$ (the charge and strong colour generators).

### T.2 Spectral leaves as excitation levels

Recall that the $12$ spectral partitions of $\mathrm{Cl}(6,6)$ are organised around three “polar” generators:

| Leaf | Generator | Physical interpretation |
|------|-----------|------------------------|
| $e_4$ | Electric charge | Electromagnetic excitations |
| $e_5$ | Strong colour (first axis) | Colour excitations |
| $e_6$ | Strong colour (second axis) | Colour excitations |

These three leaves are natural candidates to host **excitation levels** above the ground state. Specifically:

- **Ground state** ($e_1, e_2, e_3$): space generators → ground‑state hadrons ($\pi$, $K$, $p$).
- **First excitation** ($e_4$): charge‑induced excitations → $\Delta$, $\Sigma$ (strange baryons).
- **Second excitation** ($e_5, e_6$): colour‑induced excitations → $\Xi$, $\Omega$, higher resonances.

### T.3 Proposed systematic construction

#### T.3.1 Excited baryons as linear combinations of pentads\\

Let $P_i$ denote a pentad built from the $i$-th eigenvalue $\lambda_i$. A ground‑state baryon (e.g. the proton) is a **triplet of pentads** from the space leaves ($e_1,e_2,e_3$):

$$
|p\rangle = \sum_{a=1}^{3} c_a \, P_{i_a}, \qquad i_a \in \mathcal{I}_{\text{space}}.
$$

An excited baryon (e.g. $\Delta^+$) would then be a **linear combination of pentads from different leaves**:

$$
|\Delta^+\rangle = \alpha |p\rangle + \beta \, P_{i_4} + \gamma \, P_{i_5} + \delta \, P_{i_6},
$$

where $P_{i_4}, P_{i_5}, P_{i_6}$ are pentads from the charge and colour leaves ($e_4, e_5, e_6$). The coefficients $\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta$ are determined by the Clebsch‑Gordan decomposition of $SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ under the automorphism group of $\Lambda_{72}$.

#### T.3.2 Explicit candidate for $\Delta(1232)$\\

A preliminary search using the **pair rule** (difference of two pentads) applied to indices from the $e_4$ leaf gives:

| Resonance | Indices | Octaves | Predicted (MeV) | Experimental (MeV) | Error (%) |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| $\Delta(1232)$ | [14, 29] | (1,2) | 1231.8 | 1232 | $<0.02\%$ |

where $i=14$ ($\lambda_{14} = 0.079379$, $\sqrt{\lambda_{14}} = 0.2817$) and $j=29$ ($\lambda_{29} = 0.290978$, $\sqrt{\lambda_{29}} = 0.5394$), with octaves $(1,2)$. This suggests that the $\Delta$ resonance may be described by a **pair of pentads** from the $e_4$ leaf, rather than a triplet.

#### T.3.3 Hierarchy of resonances\\

We hypothesise the following excitation hierarchy:

| Excitation level | Leaf | Example resonance | Predicted mass formula |
|------------------|------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Ground | $e_1,e_2,e_3$ | $p$, $n$ | Triplet sum |
| First | $e_4$ | $\Delta(1232)$, $\Sigma(1193)$ | Pair difference |
| Second | $e_5$ | $\Xi(1318)$ | Pair difference with higher octave |
| Third | $e_6$ | $\Omega(1672)$ | Pair difference with even higher octave |

The precise indices and octaves for each resonance would be determined by a **systematic constrained search** over the corresponding spectral leaf, using the representation theory of the flavour symmetry group as a guide.

### T.4 Connection to the transition operator $T$

The transition operator $T$ (see §8) induces jumps between spectral leaves. In particular, $T_{\text{fire}}$ (fire‑water exchange) can move a pentad from the space leaves to the charge leaf $(e_4)$, while $T_{\text{water}}$ moves it to the colour leaves $(e_5, e_6)$. This provides a dynamical mechanism for resonance excitation: an external perturbation (e.g. a photon for electromagnetic transitions, a gluon for strong transitions) couples to $T$ and promotes a ground‑state hadron to an excited resonance.

### T.5 Summary and outlook

| Resonance | Current status | Proposed method | Priority |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| $\Delta(1232)$ | Candidate found (indices 14,29) | Pair rule on $e_4$ | High |
| $\Sigma(1193)$ | Not yet | Pair rule on $e_4$ (different indices) | High |
| $\Xi(1318)$ | Not yet | Pair rule on $e_5$ | Medium |
| $\Omega(1672)$ | Not yet | Pair rule on $e_6$ | Medium |
| Higher resonances | Not yet | Linear combinations + $T$ transitions | Low |

**Next steps** :

1. Complete the systematic search for $\Sigma$, $\Xi$, and $\Omega$ using the corresponding spectral leaves.
2. Derive the Clebsch‑Gordan coefficients for linear combinations from the representation theory of $\mathrm{Aut}(\Lambda_{72})$.
3. Compute transition amplitudes $T$ between ground and excited states to obtain decay widths.

These extensions are actively being pursued and will be reported in a forthcoming publication.

## Appendix U - The 7 Spectral Thresholds and Fire/Water Pentads

**Cultural context:** The parallel between the 7 spectral thresholds and the 7 double letters of the *Sefer Yetzirah*, as well as the correspondences with the *Wu Xing* and *Yi Jing*, are discussed in §6.8. This appendix focuses exclusively on the **physical implementation** of these thresholds within the $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ formalism.

### U.1 Overview

The transition operator $T$ (see §8) is not continuous; its action is gated by **seven discrete spectral thresholds** $S_1,\ldots,S_7$. These thresholds correspond to critical values of the topological tension $\mathcal{T}$ (equivalently, to specific square roots $\sqrt{\lambda_i}$ of the Nebe lattice eigenvalues). Crossing a threshold activates a specific type of transition.

### U.2 The seven thresholds

Table U.1 lists the seven thresholds with their numerical values, degeneracies, and physical roles.

| Threshold | $\sqrt{\lambda_i}$ | Degeneracy | Physical transition |
|-----------|--------------------|------------|----------------------|
| $S_1$ | 0.06614 | 2 | Minimal activation / vacuum fluctuation |
| $S_2$ | 0.10486 | 2 | Mirror symmetry (Sheng ↔ Ke) |
| $S_3$ | 0.10582 | 1 | Polarisation / spin flip |
| $S_4$ | 0.13530 | 2 | Coupling between cosmic sectors (Janus) |
| $S_5$ | 0.17195 | 1 | **Fire transition** ($T_{\text{fire}}$): electromagnetic |
| $S_6$ | 0.19329 | 2 | **Water transition** ($T_{\text{water}}$): strong / colour |
| $S_7$ | 0.21732 | 1 | **Octave jump** ($n \to n+1$) |

Crossing $S_5$ activates the fire transition (electromagnetic processes), crossing $S_6$ activates the water transition (strong/colour processes), and crossing $S_7$ triggers an octave jump (scale multiplication by $4$), which is responsible for the electroweak scale and the magnetar resonance. The lower thresholds $S_1$ to $S_4$ regulate internal rearrangements (polarisation, coupling, symmetry flips).

### U.3 Fire and water pentads

When thresholds $S_5$ and $S_6$ are crossed, specific families of pentads become active:

- **Fire pentads ($P_{\text{fire}}$)** : constructed on the charge generator $e_4$.  
  *Indices*: $\{4, 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, 40, 46, 52, 58, 64, 70\}$.  
  *Role*: electromagnetic transitions ($e^+e^- \to \gamma\gamma$, photon emission/absorption, charge flips).

- **Water pentads ($N_{\text{water}}$)** : constructed on the colour generators $e_5$ and $e_6$.  
  *Indices for $e_5$*: $\{5, 11, 17, 23, 29, 35, 41, 47, 53, 59, 65, 71\}$.  
  *Indices for $e_6$*: $\{6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72\}$.  
  *Role*: strong interactions (quark confinement, hadron formation, $\pi^0 \to \gamma\gamma$ via the anomaly).

### U.4 Relation to the transition operator $T$

The transition operator decomposes according to which thresholds are crossed:

| Operator | Activation threshold | Physical domain |
|----------|----------------------|-----------------|
| $T_{\text{fire}}$ | $\mathcal{T} \ge S_5$ | Electromagnetic |
| $T_{\text{water}}$ | $\mathcal{T} \ge S_6$ | Strong / colour |
| $T_{\text{mixed}}$ | $\mathcal{T} \ge \max(S_5,S_6)$ | Electroweak coupling |
| $T_{\text{octave}}$ | $\mathcal{T} \ge S_7 = \mu_{\Lambda_{72}} = 8$ | Scale jump ($n \to n+1$) |

### U.5 Observable signatures

| Threshold | Physical process | Observable signature |
|-----------|------------------|----------------------|
| $S_1$ | Vacuum fluctuations | Casimir effect, vacuum polarisation |
| $S_2$ | Matter–antimatter symmetry | Pair production $e^+e^-$ |
| $S_3$ | Spin polarisation | Zeeman effect, spin precession |
| $S_4$ | Cosmic sector coupling | Dark energy, Dipole Repeller |
| $S_5$ | Electromagnetic transitions | $e^+e^- \to \gamma\gamma$, atomic spectra |
| $S_6$ | Strong transitions | Hadron masses, $\pi^0$ decay |
| $S_7$ | Octave jump | Magnetar resonance (200 MeV), electroweak scale |

### U.6 Relation to the polarity gradient $3P \to 3N$

The spectral thresholds $S_1,\ldots,S_7$ are the **microscopic realization** of the macroscopic polarity descent $3P \to 3N$ (see §2.6.3). The topological tension $\mathcal{T} = \nabla \eta \cdot \nabla R_{\text{thr}}$ (see §10.6.1) controls both:

| Polarity stage | Spectral condition | Thresholds involved |
|----------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| $3P$ (pure Sheng) | $\mathcal{T} < S_1$ | Below first activation |
| $2P+1N$ (weak mixing) | $S_1 \leq \mathcal{T} < S_5$ | $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$ (entry) |
| $1P+2N$ (strong mixing) | $S_5 \leq \mathcal{T} < S_7$ | $S_5$ (fire), $S_6$ (water) |
| $3N$ (pure Ke) | $\mathcal{T} \geq S_7 = \mu_{\Lambda_{72}} = 8$ | Octave jump, cosmos inversion |

Thus, the polarity gradient is the **macroscopic envelope** of a sequence of microscopic threshold crossings. Accelerated expansion ($\ddot{a} > 0$) occurs when the system globally crosses $S_7$ and enters the $3N$ regime ($\eta < 0$).

## Appendix V - Rowlands ↔ Petit: Two Faces of the Same Pentadic Coin

### V.1. Common origin: the pentadic master equation

The formalisms of Rowlands (algebraic microphysics) and Petit (bimetric cosmology) are not independent theories but two distinct limits of a single fundamental quantum equation governing the evolution of the universal state in the pentadic Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{\text{Pent}}$:

$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} |\Psi(t)\rangle = \hat{H}_{\text{total}} |\Psi(t)\rangle,
$$

with the total Hamiltonian decomposed into three contributions intrinsic to the $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ network:

$$
\hat{H}_{\text{total}} = \underbrace{\sum_P m_P |P\rangle\langle P| \otimes \mathbb{1}_{\text{st}}}_{\hat{H}_0 \text{ (mass terms)}} 
+ \underbrace{\sum_{P,Q,R,S} T^{RS}_{PQ} (|P\rangle\langle Q|) \otimes (|R\rangle\langle S|)}_{\hat{H}_{\text{int}} \text{ (interactions)}} 
+ \underbrace{\sum_{P^+,P^-} \mu_{P^+P^-} (|P^+\rangle\langle P^-| + \text{h.c.}) \otimes \mathbb{1}_{\text{st}}}_{\hat{H}_{\text{coupling}} \text{ (bicosmic coupling)}}.
$$

The Hilbert space naturally decomposes into a direct sum of the two cosmos:
$$
\mathcal{H}_{\text{Pent}} = \mathcal{H}^+_{\text{Pent}} \oplus \mathcal{H}^-_{\text{Pent}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad |\Psi\rangle = |\Psi^+\rangle + |\Psi^-\rangle.
$$

- **Rowlands' viewpoint**: Project the master equation onto the discrete subspace $\mathcal{H}^+_{\text{Pent}}$ and retain the full quantum dynamics. The eigenstates satisfy the nilpotent closure $(g\cdot x)^2=0$, giving rise to spin-½, native Pauli exclusion, and an active vacuum. The formalism remains purely algebraic and discrete.
- **Petit's viewpoint**: Take the classical limit ($\hbar \to 0$) and describe operators by effective continuous fields $\Phi^\pm(x)$. The coupling term $\hat{H}_{\text{coupling}}$ becomes a geometric interaction between two metrics $g_{\mu\nu}^+$ and $g_{\mu\nu}^-$. The coupled field equations of Janus cosmology are recovered.

Thus, Rowlands and Petit respectively describe the **quantum microscopic limit** and the **classical macroscopic limit** of the same master equation.

---

### V.2. Rowlands → Petit: macroscopisation via coarse-graining

The transition from Rowlands' discrete formalism to Petit's continuous geometry is achieved via a *coarse-graining* map $\mathcal{C}$ that averages pentadic states over macroscopic volumes:

$$
\mathcal{C} : \mathcal{H}_P \to L^2(\mathcal{M}_4), \quad \mathcal{C}(|P_\alpha\rangle) = \psi_\alpha(x) \xrightarrow[\text{classical}]{} \Phi^\pm(x).
$$

The transition operator $T$, responsible for microscopic angular rearrangements, has its macroscopic expectation value $\langle T \rangle_{\text{macro}}$ generate the effective stress-energy tensors:

$$
T_{\mu\nu}^\pm(x) \sim \sum_{F \in CP/CN} \omega_F \, \text{Tr}\!\left( \Pi_F^\dagger \sigma_{\mu\nu}^\pm \Pi_F \right) \xrightarrow{\mathcal{C}} \langle T \rangle_{\text{macro}}^\pm.
$$

Projecting the master equation onto the classical fields $\Phi^\pm$ and retaining only the dominant terms (mass and self-interaction) yields the coupled system:

$$
\Box \Phi^+ + m_+^2 \Phi^+ = \lambda (\Phi^+ \cdot \Phi^+) + \mu (\Phi^- \cdot \Phi^-),
$$
$$
\Box \Phi^- + m_-^2 \Phi^- = \lambda (\Phi^- \cdot \Phi^-) + \mu (\Phi^+ \cdot \Phi^+).
$$

In bimetric general relativity, these source fields couple the curvatures of the two metrics via generalized Bianchi identities, leading directly to Janus' equations:

$$
R_{\mu\nu}^+ - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}^+ R^+ = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4}\left( T_{\mu\nu}^+ + T_{\mu\nu}^- \right),
$$
$$
R_{\mu\nu}^- - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}^- R^- = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4}\left( T_{\mu\nu}^- + T_{\mu\nu}^+ \right).
$$

Janus cosmology thus emerges naturally as the macroscopic limit of the coarse-grained pentadic dynamics.

### V.3. Petit → Rowlands: microscopisation via spectral decomposition

The inverse path consists of decomposing the macroscopic stress-energy tensors onto the eigenbasis of the operator $T$, whose spectrum is fixed by the geometry of the $\Lambda_{72}$ lattice. Starting from the Janus equations in vacuum with the correct coupling terms:

$$
R_{\mu\nu}^+ - \frac{1}{2}R^+ g_{\mu\nu}^+ = \chi \left( T_{\mu\nu}^+ + \sqrt{\frac{g^-}{g^+}} \, T_{\mu\nu}^- \right),
$$

$$
R_{\mu\nu}^- - \frac{1}{2}R^- g_{\mu\nu}^- = -\chi \left( T_{\mu\nu}^- + \sqrt{\frac{g^+}{g^-}} \, T_{\mu\nu}^+ \right),
$$

where $\chi = 8\pi G/c^4$ and $g^\pm = |\det(g_{\mu\nu}^\pm)|$.

The stress-energy tensors admit a spectral decomposition arising from the discrete lattice:

$$
T_{\mu\nu}^\pm(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{72} \alpha_i^\pm(x) \, \mathbf{W}_{i,\mu} \mathbf{W}_{i,\nu},
$$

where $\mathbf{W}_{i,\mu}$ are the row vectors of the projection matrix $\mathbf{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{144 \times 10}$. The factors $\sqrt{g^\mp/g^\pm}$ ensure that the Bianchi identities $\nabla_\mu^\pm (T^{\mu\nu}_\pm + \sqrt{g^\mp/g^\pm} T^{\mu\nu}_\mp) = 0$ are satisfied identically. Substituting into the Janus equations and projecting onto the eigenvectors of $T$ yields:

$$
\sum_j \left( \delta_{ij} \Box + M_{ij}^2 \right) \alpha_j^\pm(x) = \lambda \sum_{k,l} C_{ikl} \alpha_k^+ \alpha_l^- \pm \mu (\alpha^\pm)^3 + \text{volume terms}.
$$

The stationary solutions satisfy $(\lambda_n - m_n^2)\alpha_n = 0$. For each eigenmode $|\phi_n\rangle$ with $\lambda_n \neq 0$, the associated pentadic configuration satisfies $(g\cdot x)^2 = 0$, recovering Rowlands' nilpotent states. The $\pm$ sign in the cubic term reflects the fundamental asymmetry between the two cosmos encoded in the Janus equations.

For each eigenmode $|\phi_n\rangle$ with $\lambda_n \neq 0$, the associated pentadic configuration satisfies by construction the algebraic closure condition:

$$
(g \cdot x)^2 = 0,
$$

which is precisely the definition of Rowlands' nilpotent states. This return to the microscopic level is formalized by the *inverse quantization* map $\mathcal{Q}^{-1}$:

$$
\mathcal{Q}^{-1} : T_{\mu\nu}^\pm \mapsto |P\rangle \in \mathcal{H}_P, \quad \text{such that } \langle P | T | P \rangle = \int T_{\mu\nu}^\pm \, d^3x.
$$

Thus, nilpotent pentads emerge as the fundamental stationary modes of the macroscopic bimetric field. Rowlands and Petit are therefore not in competition; they describe the two faces of the same dual invariant, connected by the reciprocal maps $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{Q}^{-1}$.

## Appendix W – Primordial Cosmology without Inflation

**Note:** This appendix develops the speculative scenarios of primordial cosmology mentioned in §9. For the main cosmological discussion, see §9.1–§9.7.

### W.1 Homogeneity from generalised gauge invariance

In the Janus model, the early universe undergoes a generalised gauge transformation where all physical constants vary coherently [@Petit1988]. The speed of light $c$, the gravitational constant $G$, and particle masses scale as:

$$
c(t) \propto a(t), \quad G(t) \propto a(t)^2, \quad m(t) \propto a(t),
$$

where $a(t)$ is the scale factor. This gauge invariance preserves the form of all physical equations while ensuring that the cosmological horizon grows with the universe, maintaining homogeneity at all scales. No inflaton field is required. The transition occurs when the inter-baryon distance falls below the Compton wavelength, triggering this collective gauge evolution.

The following quantities vary simultaneously under this generalised gauge transformation:

- $\bar{c}$ (speed of light)
- $\bar{G}$ (gravitational constant)
- $\bar{\hbar}$ (reduced Planck constant)
- $\bar{m}$ (particle masses)
- $\bar{a}$ (scale factor)

All other constants (fine-structure constant $\alpha$, charge $e$, etc.) remain invariant. The horizon problem is resolved because the cosmological horizon scales with the universe's expansion, maintaining causal contact at all scales.

### W.2 CMB fluctuations as gravitational imprint of the negative sector

The Jeans length in the negative-mass sector is approximately 100 times larger than in the positive sector [@Petit2018]:

$$
\frac{L_J^{(-)}}{L_J^{(+)}} \propto \frac{a^{(-)}}{a^{(+)}} \approx 100.
$$

Consequently, density fluctuations in the Ke sector have characteristic angular scales of about one degree on the CMB sky. These fluctuations gravitationally imprint onto the positive sector through the coupling tensor $\stackrel{\frown}{T}^{(-)}_{\mu\nu}$, generating the observed CMB power spectrum without requiring primordial quantum fluctuations. This prediction distinguishes Janus from $\Lambda$CDM and can be tested with Planck data.

The temperature fluctuations $\Delta T/T$ observed by Planck are thus interpreted as the projection of negative-sector density contrasts:

$$
\frac{\Delta T}{T}(\hat{\mathbf{n}}) = \int_0^{z_{\text{rec}}} \Phi^{(-)}(r\hat{\mathbf{n}}, z) \, dz,
$$

where $\Phi^{(-)}$ is the gravitational potential in the Ke sector.

### W.3 Asymmetric speed of light

From the gauge evolution equations, the ratio of light speeds in the two sectors is [@Petit1995]:

$$
\frac{c^{(-)}}{c^{(+)}} \propto \frac{a^{(+)}}{a^{(-)}} \approx 10.
$$

Light in the negative sector travels ten times faster than in our sector. Combined with the Jeans length ratio ($L_J^{(-)}/L_J^{(+)} \approx 100$), this reduces interstellar travel times by a factor of 1000 if mass inversion could be achieved.

**Conjectured physical consequences:**

| Effect | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Faster communication | Signals in Ke sector travel 10× faster |
| Larger Jeans length | Structures in Ke sector are 100× larger |
| Travel time reduction | Interstellar travel 1000× faster (if mass inversion achieved) |

### W.4 Relation to the spectral gap $\Delta_0$

The gauge evolution is triggered when the topological tension $\mathcal{T}$ exceeds the lattice minimal norm $\mu_{\Lambda_{72}} = 8$ (see §10.6.1). This condition is equivalent to crossing the spectral threshold $S_7$, which activates the octave jump and initiates the gauge transformation. The value of $\Delta_0 = 2.5$ MeV is the energy scale at which this transition occurs in the positive sector.

### W.5 Open questions

- What determines the exact ratio $c^{(-)}/c^{(+)} = 10$? Is it related to the eigenvalues of $\Lambda_{72}$?
- How does the gauge transition couple to the pentadic network?
- Can the CMB power spectrum be quantitatively reproduced from the negative-sector density fluctuations?

## Appendix X – Bubble Universes and the Accessibility of the Big Bang

**Note:** This appendix develops speculative scenarios mentioned in §9. For the main cosmological discussion, see §9.1–§9.7.

### X.1 Bubble universes with different constants

In the Janus model, each void (bubble) in the large-scale structure may have its own set of fundamental constants ($c$, $G$, $\hbar$, $\alpha_{\text{em}}$) inherited from the gauge evolution phase [@Petit2018]. However, the form of the physical equations is identical across bubbles, ensuring similar evolutionary histories—galaxies, stars, planets, and even biomolecules can form in each. This provides a natural realisation of the "baby universe" scenario without fine-tuning.

**Properties of bubble universes:**

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Constants** | May vary between bubbles ($c$, $G$, $\hbar$) |
| **Physics** | Same equations, different parameters |
| **Evolution** | Parallel histories (stars, galaxies, life) |
| **Communication** | No interaction between bubbles (different $g_{\mu\nu}$) |

The variation of constants between bubbles is constrained by the requirement that atomic physics remains functional for life to emerge. This is a mild anthropic selection principle.

### X.2 Cosmological time and the inaccessibility of the Big Bang

In the Janus model with variable constants, an elementary clock (two masses orbiting their common centre of gravity) sees its period $T$ tend to zero as one approaches the origin [@PetitDAgostini2025]:

$$
T(t) \propto a(t) \to 0 \quad \text{as} \quad t \to t_{\text{BB}}.
$$

Consequently, the clock completes an infinite number of rotations before reaching the Big Bang. The origin is asymptotically inaccessible—a realisation of Zeno's paradox at the cosmological scale. The question "what happened before the Big Bang?" loses its meaning because one cannot operationally define "before" under these conditions.

**Diagrammatic representation:**

```
      Future
         ↑
         │
    ─────┼─────  Present
         │
    infinite number
    of rotations     Big Bang
    ─────────────────────────→ Time
    (asymptotically inaccessible)
```

### X.3 Relational time vs absolute time

In this framework, time is not an absolute parameter but a **relational quantity** defined by the number of rotations of an elementary clock. The impossibility of reaching $t=0$ reflects the fact that relational time does not have a natural origin—it is defined only up to an arbitrary reference point. This perspective aligns with the relational philosophy underlying $\text{Cl}(6,6)$ itself.

### X.4 Connection to the pentadic network

The infinite number of rotations before reaching the Big Bang corresponds to the existence of an infinite sequence of pentadic configurations as one approaches the spectral threshold $S_7$ from below. The topological tension $\mathcal{T}$ diverges as $t \to t_{\text{BB}}$, preventing the system from ever reaching the singular point.

### X.5 Open questions

- Is the infinite number of rotations a genuine physical prediction or a mathematical artefact?
- How does this scenario relate to the bounce cosmology alternatives?
- Can this be tested observationally (e.g., through signatures in the CMB)?

## Appendix Y – Cultural Isomorphisms and Ancestral Debts

### Y.1 Overview

The $64 \to 20$ reduction encoded in our transition operator $T$ and Merkabah filtration is not an isolated epistemic artifact. It appears as a **topological invariant** whose complementary projections have been articulated by distinct formal traditions across different civilizations. Their convergence — none derived from the others — validates the hypothesis of a universal constraint independent of symbolic systems.

### Y.2 The Chinese tradition: combinatorial pre‑filtering

The *Yi Jing* and *Wu Xing* (Five Phases) model the **phase of combinatorial pre‑filtering**. The 64 hexagrams constitute an exhaustive binary configuration space strictly isomorphic to the 6‑bit vectors of $\mathrm{Cl}(6,0)$. The *sheng* (generative) and *ke* (regulatory) cycles describe a five‑phase local dynamic, corresponding to the internal regulation of attractor states. This tradition formalizes the **geometry of possibilities** and the rules of relational circulation, without postulating a priori a fixed reduction to 20 functional classes.

**Correspondence table:**

| Yi Jing concept | Mathematical counterpart |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| 64 hexagrams | Binary space $\mathrm{Cl}(6,0)$ |
| Yin/Yang ($--$/$-$) | Bits 0/1 |
| Hexagram sequence | Time-ordered configurations |
| Wu Xing cycles | $CP/CN$ tropical belts |

### Y.3 The Hebrew tradition: functional post‑filtering

The *Sefer Yetzirah* operates explicitly at the level of **post‑filtering**. The 22 consonantal letters (plus 5 final *sofit* forms) encode a functional partition of semantic space into **20 stable classes plus 2 boundary states**. The letters *Aleph* (primordial breath / reference) and *Tav* (signature / closure) structurally overlap with the threshold roles of initiation and termination in biological translation (methionine / STOP codons). The canonical tripartition — **3 mothers, 7 doubles, 12 singles** — discretizes the gradient of geometric constraints, directly reflecting the polarity signatures ($3P$, $2P+1N$, $1P+2N$, $3N$) resulting from Merkabah filtration [@DeDominicis_2026].

This tripartition corresponds precisely to:

- **3 mothers** → the 3 structural elements ($e_1,e_2,e_3$)
- **7 doubles** → the 7 spectral thresholds $S_1,\ldots,S_7$
- **12 singles** → the 12 spectral partitions of $\mathrm{Cl}(6,6)$, generating $12 \times 12 = 144$ pentads

### Y.4 Mandarin phonology: independent confirmation

Although derived from a non‑alphabetic ideographic tradition, Mandarin syllabic structure is organized around a consonantal onset system of **21 initials** (often extended to 22 in educational romanizations), coupled with a minimal vowel nucleus reduced to 2–3 fundamental phonemes. This phonological architecture (~22 consonantal anchors framing a restricted vowel nucleus) structurally reflects the **20 + 2 partition**. It suggests that the compression of combinatorial complexity into stable functional classes emerges independently whenever transmission systems are constrained by analogous articulatory, perceptual, and cognitive limits — a principle that extends from language to genetics (64 codons → 20 amino acids) and, as we argue, to fundamental physics.

### Y.5 The two faces of the medal

These cultural formalisms are not superimposable; they are **orthogonal projections** of the same topological invariant. The Chinese tradition captures the **dynamics of transformation in configuration space** (pre‑filtering). The Hebrew tradition formalizes its **reduction to stable functional classes** and the definition of limit states (post‑filtering). Their convergence — independently derived, without mutual influence — validates the hypothesis of a **universal constraint** independent of symbolic systems.

Remarkably, the same complementary structure appears in contemporary physics. Jean‑Pierre Petit’s **Janus cosmology** (macro‑scale, bimetric coupling of positive and negative masses) and Peter Rowlands’ **nilpotent formalism** (micro‑scale, $(g\cdot x)^2=0$, Dirac equation, spin‑½) are two faces of the same medal. Both are orthogonal projections of the same algebraic substrate: $\mathrm{Cl}(6,6)$.

### Y.6 The traditional status of Wu Xing and Yi Jing in Imperial China

Historically, the *Yi Jing* and *Wu Xing* (Five Phases) were integrated into the ideological foundation of the Chinese imperial state from the Qin (221–207 BCE) up to the fall of the last emperor in 1924. They functioned as a **universal correlative cosmology** governing virtually every domain of imperial life:

- **Governance**: legitimation of dynastic cycles through the "Five Virtues" (*wude*); theory of the "Mandate of Heaven" (*tianming*)
- **Law**: codification of punishments and rituals according to seasonal and elemental cycles
- **Medicine**: foundation of traditional Chinese medicine via the five phases and yin‑yang
- **Military strategy**: tactical principles (Sun Tzu), troop movements aligned with seasonal elements
- **Architecture and urban planning**: orientation according to geomancy (*feng shui*)
- **Agriculture and calendar**: regulation of planting and harvesting based on solar-lunar cycles
- **Music and aesthetics**: five-tone scale, correspondence between musical notes and elements
- **Philosophy and ethics**: correlative thinking between human virtues and cosmic forces

By contrast, the societies of the ancient Near East and Mediterranean based their social order primarily on mythico‑historical narratives (e.g., theogonies, epic genealogies, biblical revelation). This difference in the *social institutionalisation* of knowledge does not affect the mathematical isomorphisms documented here, but it illustrates the diverse cultural vectors through which combinatorial invariants have been preserved.

### Y.7 On the ancestral debts of the scientific enterprise

The modern Western narrative of science often presents itself as a *tabula rasa*, a break with the past in which the scientist appears as a *novus homo* without debts to previous ways of knowing. This work challenges that narrative.

The correspondences we have documented — between the 3 mothers, 7 doubles and 12 simples of the *Sefer Yetzirah* and the 3 structural elements, 7 spectral thresholds and 12 partitions of $\mathrm{Cl}(6,6)$; between the 5 phases of the *Wu Xing* and the 3‑1‑1 decomposition of each pentad; between the 64 hexagrams of the *Yi Jing* and the binary configuration space of $\mathrm{Cl}(6,0)$ — are not mere analogies or pedagogical metaphors. They are **structural isomorphisms** between ancient combinatorial systems and the formal mathematics of a 21st‑century unification model.

These isomorphisms do not imply that ancient sages anticipated Clifford algebras or lattice theory. They suggest, rather, that certain **relational invariants** — ways of compressing combinatorial complexity into stable functional classes — have been independently discovered, under different epistemic constraints, in different civilisations and epochs. The mathematician or physicist who formalises these invariants today does not create them *ex nihilo*; he recognises patterns that have been glimpsed, from other angles, for millennia.

Acknowledging this debt is not a concession to obscurantism. It is an act of intellectual honesty. It situates the scientific enterprise within the long history of human attempts to grasp the structure of reality — a history in which the *Sefer Yetzirah*, the *Yi Jing*, and the *Wu Xing* are not relics, but early witnesses.

### Y.8 No claim of historical influence

No claim of historical influence is made. The ancient traditions did not anticipate Clifford algebras or bimetric cosmology, nor did Petit and Rowlands draw on the *Sefer Yetzirah* or the *Yi Jing*. Rather, different epistemic pathways, operating under different constraints and in different historical contexts, have converged on **structurally isomorphic solutions** to the problem of compressing combinatorial complexity into stable, functional categories — whether cognitive, linguistic, biological, or physical.

The mathematics of $\mathrm{Cl}(6,6)$ provides the common language in which these complementary projections can finally be seen as two aspects of a single unified substrate. This work is neither a proof of ancient wisdom nor a validation of modern physics by tradition. It is a **retrospective recognition** that the same relational invariants — the same "faces of the medal" — have been glimpsed, from different angles, across millennia and civilizations.
